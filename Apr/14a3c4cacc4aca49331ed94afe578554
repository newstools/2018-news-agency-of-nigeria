(Sputnik/NAN) Georgia Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili has announced he would be leaving his post as the leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party. He, therefore, proposed that the founder of the party, Bidzina Ivanishvili, be appointed to replace him. “I propose on behalf of myself and the whole team, to the founder of our party to lead the Georgian Dream.
‘’I am glad that Mister Bidzina Ivanishvili agreed,’’ Kvirikashvili told a news briefing. The prime minister added that the return of Ivanishvili, who used to lead the party, would have a positive impact on the country political life.
The party council will hold a meeting in the coming days to decide on the candidature. Kvirikashvili expressed his confidence that Ivanishvili’s nomination would be approved unanimously. Georgian Dream, founded by Ivanishvili, a prominent businessman and one of the richest people in Georgia to challenge then President Mikheil Saakashvili’s National Movement party, came to power in November 2012. Ivanishvili became prime minister after his party secured parliamentary majority and formed a new government. However, the politician resigned after one year in office to return to business, following his promise to do so once Saakashvili’s government is removed from power. Report says he is still widely considered to have a significant influence on Georgian politics. The country will have presidential election in October. Meanwhile, Georgian Dream has not yet announced its candidate.
