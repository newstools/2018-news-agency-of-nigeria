By Aisha Gambo A alleged jilted suitor, Mr Muntari Idris, on Thursday appealed to a Sharia court at Magajin Gari in Kaduna State to help him to recover N68,000 he spent on his ex-fiancee. Idris, who resides at Kawo, told the court that he got engaged to Miss Ummahani Manji in 2016 and paid N25,000 to her guardian, Mr Abdullahi Tarazo, as dowry, but she abandoned him. The complainant told the court that Manji called off their engagement 16 days to their wedding. He said that he needed refund of the dowry and all other expenses on Manji throughout their courtship. “I spent a total of N68,000 on Ummahani; I gave Baba Abdullahi N25,000 dowry, paid for transport to Saminaka where her parents live, showered them with gifts and also sewed clothes for Ummahani. “I want this honourable court to help me to recover the amounts from Ummahani because she refused to marry me and married someone else,” he prayed. Responding, Manji, however, refuted Idris’s claim of spending up to N68,000 on her. She told the court that she only knew of the N25,000 dowry and a Nokia phone he gave her. She submitted that she did not call off the engagement. Manji said that Idris told her that he was no longer interested in the relationship. “He is the one that called off the engagement shortly after we had a misunderstanding on the postponement of our wedding,” she said. She prayed the court to give her up until the end of April to refund Idris the N25,000 dowry. The judge, Malam Musa Saad, adjourned the case to April 24 for evidence by witnesses.
