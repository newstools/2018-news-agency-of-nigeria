By Kelechi Ogunleye Suspected commercial motorcycle operators have attacked a Vehicle Inspection Office (VIO) personnel in Abuja. Spokesman of the agency, Mr Kalu Emetu, disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Tuesday. Emetu identified the victim as Mr Abubarkar Eyge. He said the incident occurred at the Area 1 roundabout in the Garki District of the territory on Monday morning. He said that the Okada riders attacked the officer when he tried  to take an impounded motorcycle to the operational base of the Ministerial Joint Task Force in Wuye District. The spokesman said a group of the riders mobilised and pounced on Eyge, inflicting serious injuries on him. `This is one of the hazards of being a VIO personnel, especially in Abuja. “The attack would have been more serious if not for the intervention of passersby. “The officer is now receiving treatment at a medical facility,’’ he said. Emetu said that the matter had been reported to the police for investigation and prosecution. He said attacks on vehicle inspection officers were becoming a daily occurrence in the FCT. He said seven VIO personnel were killed in similar circumstances in the territory in 2017.
