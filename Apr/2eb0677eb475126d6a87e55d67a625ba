What a dramatic victory for defending champions Real Madrid, having to endure Juventus  3-0 trashing at Santiago Bernabeu and then getting the winning goal via Cristiano Ronaldo’s  penalty in the dying seconds! The second leg of the UEFA quarter-final was almost going into extra-time in the 92nd minute, when Medhi Benatia pushed in the box Lucas Vazquez who had received a header from Ronaldo. The English referee, Michael Oliver blew for a penalty and that triggered reactions from Juventus players. Keeper and captain Gianluigi Buffon was given a red card for contesting with the referee the decision. After Buffon left, ex-Arsenal keeper,  Wojciech Szczesny was called into action . But he had no answer for Ronaldo’s 97th minute penalty. He slotted the ball into the corner, to earn Madrid a third successive semi-final ticket in the UEFA championship. Madrid joined the other qualifiers, Liverpool, Bayern Munich and Roma. What a game at the Santiago Bernabeu!. Juve had produced a stunning performance. Mario Mandzukic’s brace and a Blaise Matuidi goal put them 3-0 up in little over an hour, levelling the tie on aggregate after Real’s 3-0 victory in Italy last week. Mandzukic twice headed in right-wing crosses at the back post for Juve in the first half, and a horrible Keylor Navas error allowed Matuidi to make it 3-0 on the night in the 61st minute. Real had looked vulnerable, but the late drama made them avoid an embarrassing exit to match that of rivals Barcelona at the hands of Roma 24 hours earlier.
