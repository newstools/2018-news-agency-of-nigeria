By Shuaib Sadiq The police have confirmed a complaint lodged by Sen. Suleiman Hunkuyi, of an attack on him and his supporters at a meeting in Kaduna on Sunday. Hunkuyi (APC Kaduna North) escaped being killed by the thugs during a political gathering of stakeholders and leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) which he convened. He convened the meeting to sensitise party supporters to resist an alleged plan to impose candidates on them during the APC Congresses scheduled from May 5. Thugs stormed the venue of the meeting at ENDwell Hotel in the city centre, brandishing all kinds of weapons and throwing stones on the supporters chanting “Kaduna sai Uba Sani, Kaduna Sai El-Rufai in 2019.” In the process, five persons sustained injuries and are receiving treatment at Barau Dikko and Garkuwa hospitals in the metropolis, while many vehicles destroyed. Mr. James Obute, Media Aide to the Senator, said: “Those who sustained injuries were taken to Garkuwa Hospital and Barau Dikko specialists Hospital where they are receiving treatment.’’ “Some vehicles’ windscreens, including those belonging to the Chairman ATAR Communication and leader of APC Restoration group, Mr. Tijjani Ramalan, were broken by the thugs. Meanwhile, Hunkuyi, who has visited the injured persons in the two hospitals condemned the attack. According to him, the thugs may have been sponsored by those who are feeling jittery of his political acceptance in the state. He said the gathering was not a political campaign but meant to sensitise stakeholders and party supporters to resist imposition of delegates through affirmation or selection during the party congresses in the state. Hunkuyi said he had been in politics for the last 30 years but had never had such an encounter. The Commissioner of Police, Mr. Austin Iwar, confirmed that Hunkuyi had lodged a complaint with the police on the attack. He, however, declined further comments.
