Tragedy struck over the weekend as a 23-year-old woman was killed by lightning at a Florida mud bog and four other people were hurt.  The lightning killed Kourtney Lambert, reportedly unfolded at Woodpecker Mud Bog in White Springs on Saturday afternoon. The lightning hit a tree before it reached a nearby trailer, Hamilton County Sheriff Harrell Reid told the media.  During mud bogging, people run large trucks or off-road vehicles through a pit of mud. Lonnie Inez Pate offered her condolences for Lambert on Facebook, describing her as a colleague. “She was a sweet person, always helping other people. Funny to!! I will hold on to the memories. R.I.P Kourtney Lambert,” Pate wrote. Lambert, of Branford, worked at UF Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville, according to her Facebook profile.
