By Blessing Ibegbu A housewife, Mrs Sandra Ekpa, on Friday begged an Upper Area Court in Mararaba, Nasarawa State, to dissolve her three-year-old marriage because her husband allegedly practices juju and also denies her sex. Ekpa told the court that her pastor husband, Gideon Adejoh, had ruined their marriage and killed the love she had for him. She said that she married Adejoh on April 18, 2015 according to native laws and custom of the Igala people in Kogi. She said that the union was blessed with a child. “Shortly after our marriage, my husband began to do awful things in the house like practicing juju and seeking extra-powers. “In addition, my husband stopped having sex with me ever since I gave birth to my baby, who is a year and six months old now. “I have made all efforts to see that he changed for good but all proved abortive, rather he kept telling me to pack and go if I cannot stay.’’ The divorce-seeking woman told court that there was no longer love in the marriage and as such “I cannot continue again because I have lost the love and affection I had for him.” She pleaded for immediate dissolution of the marriage and for the court to grant her custody of the only child from the union. Ekpa also asked the court to compel the respondent to pay her N30, 000 monthly for the child’s upkeep. However, Adejoh denied the allegations, pleading with court to give him time to enable him and his wife to discuss and appraise the issues. The Presiding Judge, Mr Ibrahim Shekarau, adjourned the case until May 3 to allow the parties settle out of court.
