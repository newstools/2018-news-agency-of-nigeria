By Gami Tadanyigbe Former councillors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have elected national executives that will pilot the affairs of members across the country. The new executives were elected at the forum’s national convention held in Abuja. The Patron of the forum, Danladi Etsu Zhin, said the new body would help in setting up structures that would bring development closer to rural dwellers. Zhin, a former Chairman of Kuje Area Council in the FCT, served as councillor between 1991 and 1993. He noted that councillors were closer to the grassroots and should be provided with a platform to always contribute towards effective development of their people. He described the forum as “political mobiliser” that needed full attention to boost development across the 774 local governments in the country. Zhin said the idea of the forum was initiated as a means of connecting government to the people at the local level, as well as ensuring APC’s victory at the forthcoming elections. In their separate acceptance speeches, the forum’s Chairman, Egop Igah, from Rivers State, and Secretary, Hajiya Aisha Yakubu, pledged their commitment to connect political office holders together.
