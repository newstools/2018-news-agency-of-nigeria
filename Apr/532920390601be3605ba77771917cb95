By Ikenna Uwadileke The House of Representatives on Wednesday summoned President Muhammadu Buhari to appear before it to explain the spate of killings in many parts of the country. The assembly also passed a vote of no confidence on the country’s Service Chiefs and all the security advisers to the president. It further resolved to suspend sitting for three legislative days to express displeasure over the recurring killings. These resolutions followed the unanimous adoption of a motion under matters of urgent public importance moved by Rep Mark Gbillah (Benue-APC). Nigeria has been facing security challenges, ranging from Boko Haram insurgency in the Northeast, herdsmen and farmers’ fights in the North Central States, among others. On Tuesday morning, persons suspected to be herdsmen attacked and killed worshippers, including two priests, in a Catholic Church in Benue. In Borno, which is the epicentre of Boko Haram activities, suicide bombers attacked a mosque in Bama at the weekend,   killed two persons and injured eight others.
