Big brother Naija is a reality show where 20 contestants (house mates) live together for a period of three months; housemates are evicted each week until a winner emerges. The winner goes home with N25 million cash prize and other benefits. The residents who spoke about the show with the News Agency of Nigeria  had varied opinions.
