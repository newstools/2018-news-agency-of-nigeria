The people of Kogi West Senatorial district turned out in large number  in some of the polling stations on Saturday for the verification of signatures for the recall process of embattled Senator Dino Melaye. There were reports by NAN correspondents in Lokoja and some LGs that the turn out was poor. The verification process started with low turn out early in Saturday and peaked later in the afternoon, said a report on a TV network. Constituents who had petitioned the INEC about the lawmakers’ recall came out to verify their signatures at various polling units.          The verification exercise taking place today followed a  meeting of stakeholders convened by INEC on Wednesday in Lokoja, the Kogi State capital. According to a timetable released by the electoral umpire, the outcomes of the exercise will be declared on Sunday, April 29. Against apprehensions that Card Readers might malfunction and mar the recall process of Sen. Dino Melaye (APC-Kogi West), verification officers have confirmed their effectiveness in the exercise. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) correspondents who monitored the verification exercise in Lokoja and Kogi Local Government Areas on Saturday also confirmed adequate security and peaceful conduct of the exercise. The polling Officer at Ukwo-Okoriko Compound, Ward A, Unit 003, Koton-Karfe, Musa Iliasu and Sen. Dino Melaye verification agent at the unit, Imam Sani said the cards readers did not malfunction throughout the exercise. At Banda, Oworo Ward 8, Unit 012, Johnson Salifu also confirmed the functionality of the card reader. Patricia Aifakokhan, the NYSC Polling Officer at Lokoja Ward B sharing the views of her contemporaries in other units confirmed that the card readers functioned perfectly. Administrator of Kogi LGA, Mohammed Tanko Musa, said he was impressed with the orderly conduct of the exercise adding that though the township witnessed low turnout, reports from the hinterlands would be different. Meanwhile, the senator is currently receiving treatment at the National Hospital in Abuja following injuries probably sustained when he jumped out of a police vehicle to escape arrest. Police men remain stationed at the National Hospital, where Melaye is still receiving treatment. He was arrested to face trial in Kogi over allegations made by some hoodlums who alleged that the senator supplied them with weapons.
