President Muhammadu Buhari has arrived Washington D.C. in readiness for a meeting with US President Donald Trump on Monday. As a guest of the US Government, President Buhari is staying at Blair House, the US President’s guest house. The Blair House used to be a complex of four formerly separate buildings—but a major renovation between 1950s and 1980s strung them together  as a single facility. The President’s Guest House has been called “the world’s most exclusive hotel” because it is primarily used to host visiting dignitaries and other guests of the president.  It is larger than the White House and closed to the public.
