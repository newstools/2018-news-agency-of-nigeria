The Israeli army on Friday dropped leaflets near the Gaza border warning Palestinians to keep away from the fence dividing the enclave from Israel ahead of mass protests expected later in the day. In a statement, the army said its aircraft had dropped leaflets saying that it would “not abide damage to security infrastructure and the fence, which protect Israeli citizens, and will target anyone who attempts to harm Israel’s security.” Palestinian protesters have clashed with Israeli forces for three consecutive Fridays, with last week’s demonstration including the use of makeshift explosive devices and an attempt to storm the border, according to the army. Thirty-five Palestinians have been killed and hundreds of others injured by Israeli gunfire since last month. The army’s leaflets also addressed Gaza residents directly, saying: “You are participating in violent disturbances. Hamas is using you to carry out terror activity,” a reference to the radical Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip. Protest organizers said they would gradually move the camps towards the fence until May 15. They are currently about 700 metres away from the fence.
