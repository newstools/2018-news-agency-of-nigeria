By Racheal Ishaya The Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) is to partner USAID Nigeria on avenues that can be employed to boost the quality of education through Public Private Partnership (PPP). This is the outcome of a courtesy visit by the Acting Director General of the Commission, Engr. Chidi Izuwah to the USAID Education office Director, Croshelle Harris-Hussein. Speaking during the visit, the ICRC boss posited that basic education is critical to national development in every country of which Nigeria is not an exception. “It is imperative to create an enabling environment for the Public and Private sector to harness capital to upscale the quality of education in Nigeria. He stressed that Public Private Partnership (PPP) is a viable option that would pull the required capital needed to enhance the quality of education and widen accessibility to safe and quality education. “It is absolutely pertinent at this time to make use of Public Private Partnership to pull the required capital to upscale educational services as less than 1% of school age children have access to quality education,” he said. Responding, the Education Director USAID, Croshelle Harris – Hussein appreciated the intent and emphasized the need to develop additional intervention modules that would facilitate the provision of quality education in different zones of the country. He said that education was very important in those areas where conflicts have left hundreds of internally displaced children and youth without learning opportunities.
