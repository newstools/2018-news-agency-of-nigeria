18-year-old Ruti Olajugbagbe has been crowned the winner of The Voice UK, the Sun newspaper has reported. She was up against Donel Mangena, Belle Voci and Lauren Bannon in the final but managed to come out on top and win a record deal. Her first single ‘Dreams’ has also been released.  Ruti was mentored by Sir Tom Jones who’s described her as a “wonderful, magical” singer. All of the finalists sang a duet with their mentors during the show before the final two were revealed: Ruti and Donel. Donel had been the favourite throughout the series. Although he didn’t win, his coach Will.i.am revealed that Prince Harry has invited him to perform at the Queen’s 92nd birthday celebrations. Ruti – who is a student and part-time carer – was second favourite behind Donel Mangena going into the final, with bookies offering odds of 17/10 on her winning. But win she did, meaning her debut single was released immediately after the final finished. She also won £100,000, and a record deal with Polydor. In her spare time, 18-year-old Ruti from Essex is part of both a harmony group and a dance crew. She said in an interview that her Nigerian dad is her inspiration. Ruti lives with her mum, dad and little brother Femi and currently attends the Youth Creation Performing Arts School in Stanford-le-Hope.
