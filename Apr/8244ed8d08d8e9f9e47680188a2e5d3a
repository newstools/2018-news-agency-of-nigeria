President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday approved the appointment of Amb. Apollonius Demenongu Agev from Benue State and Mr. Kio Solomon Benibo  Amieyeofori  from Rivers State   as Deputy Directors-General (DDGs) of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA). The Permanent Secretary in the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Olusegun A. Adekunle, disclosed this in a statement in Abuja. The appointments, according to the statement, are in fulfilment of Para. 4 (1) & (2) of the relevant Instrument establishing the NIA. “The Director-General of the National Intelligence Agency (DGNIA) in line with the provisions of the Instrument under reference, will assign areas of responsibilities to the DDGs who will assist him in carrying out his functions as Director-General,” the statement added. The appointments take immediate effect. Ahmed Rufai Abubakar, who heads the agency as DG, was appointed by President Buhari in January this year, after a former DG, Ayo Oke was sacked over the $44million recovered in a private flat in Lagos.
