Yulia Skripal, the 33-year-old daughter of a former Russian double agent who was poisoned alongside him in Britain last month, has been released from hospital, an official from Salisbury District Hospital said Tuesday. Doctor Christine Blanshard said that the younger Skripal left the premises late Monday after responding “exceptionally well” to treatment, adding that her father had made a slower recovery but would be discharged “in due course.” Sergei Skripal and his 33-year-old daughter were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury on March 4 following exposure to Novichok, a nerve agent. Britain has maintained that Russia was responsible for the attack – something Russia has denied. Many Western countries have sided with Britain by expelling Russian diplomats. The elder Skripal, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence, was convicted of selling Russian state secrets to Britain in 2006. He was traded to Britain in a high-profile spy swap four years later.
