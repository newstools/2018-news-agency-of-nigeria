This is not the best of time for Tristan Thompson, the boyfriend of Khloe Kardashian, after a new video showed him cheating on the U.S. reality TV star back in October of 2017. Reports had surfaced over the weekend of Thompson cheating on Khloe Kardashian’s in New York City. TMZ posted a video of Thompson very clearly cheating on Khloe taken roughly three months into her pregnancy. The “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” star is expected to give birth very soon, and now the event will likely be marred by the NBA star’s infidelity. In the video, the Cleveland Cavaliers player can be seen on a couch in a nightclub with three women. He makes out with one and a second sticks his head between her breasts soon after. The same girl then appears to grab Thompson’s genitals, and he puts up no protest for her to stop. The news comes at a particularly damning time for Thompson, who was busted in NYC just this past weekend, while Khloe was nine months into her pregnancy, apparently kissing another woman. The Daily Mail first posted videos of Thompson inside a club appearing to swap spit with a woman. Soon after, “The Shade Room” posted a separate video that shows them both entering his hotel in New York and leaving together soon after. So far, Khloe has yet to comment on the matter or whether or not she’s gone into labour, as some reports indicate. The reports of his cheating come just one day after the star posted an image of the two of them kissing on Instagram while he holds her baby bump. Read also
