By Joy Kaka A Kubwa Grade 1 Area Court on Friday sentenced 30-year-old man Musa Jimoh to five strokes of the cane for stealing a standing fan. The Judge, Mohammed Marafa, however, warned Jimoh, who was charged with one count of theft, to be of good behaviour and to desist from committing crime.‎ Earlier, the prosecutor, Babajide Olanipekun, had told the court that Jimoh dishonestly stole a Binatone‎ standing fan from Peace Mass Transit Company, Mpape, Abuja, on April 8. Olanipekun said that Jimoh took the fan to Byazhin Kubwa, Abuja, in an attempt to sell it but was caught and arrested on April 10 and the fan recovered from him. He said that the offence contravened Section 286 of the Penal Code. Jimoh pleaded for leniency, saying that he stole the fan in order to use the proceeds to travel for his late mother’s burial.
