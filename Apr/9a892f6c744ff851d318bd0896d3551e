British police have beefed-up security on the streets of London with the deployment of about 300 officers to confront the increasing crime rate. Stabbing and shootings have sparked fears into residents in recent days on the streets of London as there have been more than 50 homicides in 2018 alone. The crime wave has drawn criticism of London’s mayor, police tactics and government spending cuts. Metropolitan Police chief Cressida Dick said violent crime is “a long-term problem which requires concerted long-term effort.” But former chief Ian Blair said budget cuts mean there are fewer officers on the beat. He further said that “if you take 20 percent of the Met’s money away, something gives and the thing that has given is neighborhood policing.”
