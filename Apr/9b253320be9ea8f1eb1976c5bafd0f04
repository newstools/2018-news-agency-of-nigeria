Usain Bolt’s heir apparent Yohan Blake will sprint for gold in the 100-metre final at the Commonwealth Games on Monday. The Jamaican is chasing one of the 33 golds up for grabs on day four of the Gold Coast Games. Blake said he had a “lot more in the tank” after qualifying with a lightning fast 10.06 seconds in the semis on Sunday. Australia topped the leader board by finishing the third day of the competition with 31 golds, followed by England’s 19. Canada and India were tied with seven golds each, but the North Americans have more silvers and bronzes. There are six medals up for grabs on the track on Monday, including the men’s decathletes who compete in 100m sprint, long jump, shot put, high jump and 400m. Day four also sees the women’s 100m sprint finals, with England’s Asha Philip leading the semi-finals with 11.21 seconds, one-hundredth of a second ahead of Jamaica’s Christania Williams. The men’s and women’s squash singles gold are also set to be decided. England’s Sarah-Jane Perry will take on New Zealand’s Joelle King, while England’s James Willstrop, in his third consecutive Games final, faces New Zealand’s Paul ‘Superman’ Coll. There will also be plenty of action in the pool. Olympic champion Penny Oleksiak, 17, of Canada will face Australian sisters Cate and Bronte Campbell in a replay of the 100m final in 2016 in Rio. A win in the 100m butterfly would see South Africa’s Chad Le Clos claim a hat-trick of gold medals after he already claimed the 50m and 200m butterfly titles.
