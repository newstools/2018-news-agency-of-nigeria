  Leaders from the Catholic and Orthodox Church in Syria have condemned Saturday’s air strikes in the country by the US, UK and France. In a statement issued by the Patriarchates of Antioch and all the East for the Greek Orthodox, Syrian Orthodox, and Greek-Melkite Catholic Damascus, the faith leaders questioned the legality behind the move. They stated that the “brutal aggression” is a “clear violation of the international laws and the UN Charter”, and was an “unjustified assault” on a sovereign country that is a member of the United Nations. “It causes us great pain that this assault comes from powerful countries to which Syria did not cause any harm in any way,” the church leaders added. “The allegations of the USA and other countries that the Syrian army is using chemical weapons and that Syria is a country that owns and uses this kind of weapon, is a claim that is unjustified and unsupported by sufficient and clear evidence. “This brutal aggression destroys the chances for a peaceful political solution and leads to escalation and more complications.” Source :https://www.premierchristianradio.com/News/World/Catholic-and-Orthodox-Church-condemn-brutal-and-unjustified-assault-on-Syria
