By Dorcas Jonah The National Council for Women Societies (NCWS) has condemned the invasion of the National Assembly by some political thugs, describing the Senate mace hijack as desecration of the chamber. Mrs Gloria Shoda, President of NCWS in a statement issued on Monday in Abuja, said the action which has tarnished the image of the Senate, was a threat to democracy and the unity of Nigeria. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that on April 18, the Senate plenary was disrupted after suspected thugs invaded the chamber and made away with the mace. The incident was said to have happened few seconds after a suspended Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege entered the chamber. According to Shoda, for thugs to defy security arrangement of the National Assembly and perpetrate the desecration, goes to show how porous the nation’s security system is. Shoda noted that if thugs could invade the Senate, it means that nowhere in this country was safe. She called for investigation and prosecution of anyone found to be complicit in the incident. She said that there appeared to be an institutional conspiracy for the thugs to beat the tight security at the National Assembly. “This ugly development is capable of creating serious crisis than what we already have and every woman should stand to condemn this act,’’ she said. The council also condemns the beating of a female security officer who was performing her legitimate, by the suspected thugs. Shoda said “It is a shame that the thugs extended their barbaric act to a woman on duty”. She called on the Federal Government and the security agencies to find out those involved in this “shameful act of assaulting woman”. “Violence against women must not be tolerated in a society and perpetrators must face the full wrath of the law. Women’s rights are human rights,”she said. Read also: Mace saga: How Ekweremadu redeemed lawmakers image
