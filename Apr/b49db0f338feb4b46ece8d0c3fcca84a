The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, on a visit to Offa, Kwara State, gave an assurance that the Federal Government will leave no stone unturned to ensure better security for all Nigerians. The Minister spoke on Sunday when he paid a condolence visit to the traditional ruler of Offa, Oba Mufutau Gbadamosi, following the recent deadly robbery attack in the town that left nine policemen and eight civilians, dead. ”We will learn the necessary lessons from this dastardly attack and factor them into developing a better security architecture for the country to ensure the safety and security of the people of Offa and indeed all Nigerians,” he said. Alhaji Mohammed said though the armed robbers killed and maimed, they
did not succeed in breaking the spirit of the people of Offa, who have
continued bustling with energy and their trademark entrepreneurial spirit. He gave the assurance that all the others, yet to be arrested would also be
apprehended and brought to justice. The Minister had earlier paid a condolence visit to Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed of Kwara State, as well as the State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Lawan Ado. During the visit to the Commissioner, he thanked the police for their efforts to keep Nigerians safe, against all odds. Alhaji Mohammed also visited the State General Hospital and the
University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, where the nine injured persons
are being treated, to wish them a speedy recovery.
