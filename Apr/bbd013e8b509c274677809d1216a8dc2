Bauchi residents once again have proven that President Muhammadu  Buhari remains their loved leader as they trooped out today to accord him an enthusiastic welcome. One of the touching people that received  Buhari into the ancient city was a  20 year-old physically-challenged  girl, Miss Fatima Abubakar. She wheeled herself  from Toro town to Bauchi, to have a glimpse of President Muhammadu Buhari. Toro town, a Local Government headquarters, is about 100 km from Bauchi. “I came along with my brother, spending N700 on transportation, to see Buhari and wave to him, but because I was born without limbs, I could not stand. “He did not see me, but at least I came and celebrated his visit with the crowd. I welcomed him to my state, and so I am happy,” she told NAN. Abubakar said although the financial expenses she incurred was ‘a colossal burden’ considering her poor background, she had fulfilled her dream of welcoming President Buhari to her state.
