The Nigerian police said they have arrested three of the gang members, including their ring leader, who attacked last December the Abuja farm of Ibrahim Magu, the acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. Two other members of the gang, who are Air Force personnel are facing separate disciplinary action by the Force. They are yet to be released to the police. During the attack on 12 December, 2007, two AK 47 rifles were stolen and a police sergeant on guard duty, was killed. The police in a statement said the guns stolen by the gang were recovered from one of the suspects in his home in Otukpo, Benue State. According to police investigation, the gang leader, Inalegwu Omikpa, 36 years old, contacted Lance CPL Vincent Michael (a.k.a Romeo), having received information about the farm from another  gang member, Francis Ochife. Francis Ochife, who is 38 years has admitted his role. Vincent Michael, a dismissed NAF Lance Corporal, a.k.a Romeo has confessed to have recruited two other gang members currently in custody of the Nigerian Air Force. The police said Michael was handed over to them after being dismissed by the Nigerian Air Force over the commission of other crimes. Michael had kept the stolen guns in Otukpo. The police said all the  suspects would be arraigned in court on completion of investigation.
