A fake Facebook account has been opened for President Muhammadu Buhari’s daughter, Zahra, the presidency alerted on Friday. Femi Adesina, the president’s media adviser said the cloned account was the handiwork of mischief makers, who have taken the antics against the First Family to another level. “Merchants of mischief have taken their antics against the first family further by creating a fake Facebook account in the name of Zahra, President Muhammadu Buhari’s daughter. The fake account, conspicuously different from the authentic one, was used to post a message on April 17, 2018, at 9.07 a.m. “A picture of President Buhari, with snowflakes all over him, and being welcomed to a foreign country was used, alongside this message: “Children of God, here is a 75 years old man walking in the snow without cardigan just to rescue the battered economic status of Nigeria and some of you senseless people feel he travels too much, as if he travels for partying or merry making. “God bless Nigeria. Please share…” “The Presidency hereby repudiates the Facebook account, as it does not belong to Zahra. Members of the public are urged to be wary, and see through the intentions of those behind the fakery. They seek to attract odium to the first family, and also do not mean well for our country.” Zahra married last year to Muhammed Indimi.
