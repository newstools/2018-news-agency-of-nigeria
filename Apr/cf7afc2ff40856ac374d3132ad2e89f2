Some hoodlums attacked the office of the Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC) in Mopamuro Local Government of Kogi state on Saturday. The hoodlums disrupted the collation of results, shot  in the air, damaged vehicles and escaped with results sheets, while the INEC staff fled for safety. One of the INEC staff, who spoke on condition of anonymity, alleged that the hoodlums were political thugs who accompanied an aide of Gov. Yahaya Bello to the INEC office to challenge the outcome of the verification exercise as it did not favour them. The hijack of the result sheets at the council, was one of the low points of the exercise to recall Senator Dino Melaye, who represents Kogi West in the Senate. The verification of the signatures calling for his recall was marred  by low voters turn out at many polling units.
