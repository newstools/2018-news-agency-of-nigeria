Comrade Oladele Nihi, an aspirant for the seat of the President, National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), says he is excited over President Muhammadu Buhari’s decision to seek re-election in 2019. Nihi, who addressed newsmen on Wednesday in Abuja, said that the President’s declaration had put to rest the speculations on whether he would run in the 2019 elections or not. “Before now, we have listened to comments from both the sides of those who want the President to re-contest and those who do not. “Others have even written open letters and counter letters advising the president of what to do. “All these created some form of palpable tension in the polity. We are happy that the uncertainty has been brought to an end by Mr President’s decision”. Nihi, who is the Chairman Kogi State chapter, NYCN, said it was time for all interested parties to return to the drawing board to strategise the way forward and let the people decide. He lauded Buhari for the successes achieved so far in the area of security, anti-corruption fight, economy and social welfare. The aspirant however, urged the President to ensure the total independence of INEC in carrying out its duties. According to him, INEC is the umpire that will oversee the conduct of the 2019 elections and the scope of its independence will determine how efficient and effective it would be. “Though we are optimistic about free, fair and credible elections in 2019, youths must remain steadfast and avoid being used as tools to propagate disunity among ourselves. It takes the collective effort of all to achieve a better Nigeria,’’ Nihi said. He used the opportunity to call on the President to, as a matter of importance assent to the Not Too Young To Run Bill to give room for more people to participate in the electoral processes. Nihi also pleaded with the president to reconsider his decision on the Peace Corps of Nigeria Bill as it was youth-oriented.
