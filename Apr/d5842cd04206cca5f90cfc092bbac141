By Ifeanyi Nwoko The Senator representing Anambra North in the National Assembly has taken the fight against erosion in her constituency to new heights as she partners a federal environmental agency to rescue her people. Oduah who is partnering with Advanced Global Resources and Bora Agro NIG  LTD/IAR & T, commenced the planting of 4,100 trees in parts of her constituency affected by gully. Anambra state is known to have grappled with the problem of erosions for many years. Many indigenes of the state have farmlands, homes and even loved ones as a result of erosion. In a bid to check the problem, Oduah who is Chairman of the Senate Committee on Cooperation and Integration, is planting the trees as a permanent solution to the erosion problems. According to Oduah, tree planting is the most natural and permanent solution to combating erosion hence her decision to embark on it. “My people have suffered for many years from the adverse effect of erosions especially during the rainy seasons. Many of them have lost their farmlands and their homes. “Some are living in poverty because erosion has washed away their sources of livelihood and their investments. “Our target is to get as many trees planted that will serve as a permanent solution to this problem. Tree planting is also in tandem with the United Nation’s Campaign to plant a billion trees every year. “Apart from checking erosion, trees also combats climate change, conserves water, it cleans the air, provides oxygen: a single tree can give as much as 11 tons of oxygen. “I encourage Nigerians especially those in Anambra and parts who have problems with erosion to embrace tree planting because of its benefits,” she said. She expressed optimism that as the trees grow, the people in the affected communities can have their lives back and go about their farming activities on an erosion-free land.
