Saudi Arabian security forces shot down a toy drone near King Salman’s palace in the capital Riyadh on Saturday, a senior official and the state news agency said. Videos were posted online showing gunfire in the palace’s neighbourhood. A spokesman for the Riyadh police said forces at a checkpoint in the Khozama district identified the drone and “dealt with it according to their orders”, state news said without specifying if there were any injuries or damage. King Salman was not present in his palace in Riyadh on Saturday when security forces shot down the drone in the area, a senior Saudi official told Reuters. “The king was at his farm in Diriya,” the official said, naming another area of the capital.
