By Ifeanyi Nwoko The President of the Senate on Sunday, paid a condolence visit to the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) camp in Kwara state over the death of a corps member, Miss Hilda Amadi. Amadi, a graduate of Oil and Gas Engineering from the University of Port Harcourt, Rivers State, was participating in the ongoing orientation exercise for new members of the National Youth Service in Kwara State, when she reportedly slumped and died. Another account said that she had fractured one of her legs and died from complication resulting from not getting good medical attention. Saraki who visited the NYSC Camp commiserated with other members of the corps over the demise of their colleague. Although the President of the Senate was on a condolence visit, the corps members were very elated to receive him as his visit turned to a fanfare of cheers from the youths. The death of the corps member was confirmed by the Kwara State Coordinator, NYSC, Mr. Remigius Amaefule. He, however, denied insinuations that there was no experienced resident doctor in the camp at the time of the incident. “At this stage, what we need is to condole with the parents of the girl and let them know that we are very sorry for what happened. “NYSC, being a responsible organisation, does not take the safety and wellbeing of corps members lightly. Insinuations of an experienced doctor not being at the camp’s clinic when she was taken there are not true. “A day before the commencement of camp, which is our normal practice, a consultant from the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital moves into camp with us. So a consultant had been there. “The same consultant saw her, handled her case on that fateful day. It was the same consultant that took her to the General Hospital in Share and later to the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital. “So there is no truth in any insinuation that there was no qualified doctor in the camp’s clinic.”
