By Modupe Adeloye/ Ibadan No fewer than seven buildings  at  the University of  lbadan(UI), including Tedder and Bello halls of residence   were badly damaged as a result of  a downpour  on Friday night. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that some of the other  buildings affected were  the Students Union Government building and the Chemistry Laboratory of the institution’s  International School. Others affected were  some  structures in the Faculty of Agriculture as well as  the  electric transformer at the SUG  building. Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Administration), Prof. Emilolorun Aiyelari, described the incident  as unfortunate. Aiyelari  said that the institution had  yet to determine the cost of repairing the damage, adding that the incident would not affect academic activities. “We have recorded a lot of damage, unquantified  for now, but we will soon be able to know how much it will cost. “This will not affect our academic activities because our students are on holiday except for the post graduate students writing their projects. “ You know we are resuming on the 16th of this month. We will have enough time to repair them,’’ he said.
