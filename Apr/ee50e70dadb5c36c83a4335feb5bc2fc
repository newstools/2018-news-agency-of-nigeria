Roma will hope for another miracle at  Stadio Olimpico next week as they had against Barcelona, to overturn Liverpool’s 5-2 lead in the first leg of their UEFA Champions semi-final. Roma eerily were able to bank two goals away at Liverpool. And that may be to their advantage if they were able to repeat their quarter-final feat in overturning a 1-4  disadvantage by ousting former champions Barcelona . Liverpool were on the rampage in the first 69 minutes, scoring five goals, with a brace each by Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane scoring the fifth goal. But the Anfield team weakened in the last ten minutes conceding the goal by Edin Dzeko in the 81st  minute and a penalty in the 85th minute by Diego Perotti, following a hand ball by James Milner.
