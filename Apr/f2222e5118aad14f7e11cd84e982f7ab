To avoid any possible outbreak of salmonella, a bacterium that can cause food poisoning and typhoid fever, no fewer than 200 million eggs are being recalled in the United States (U.S.). Rose Acre Farms of Seymour, Ind., is voluntarily recalling the eggs due to possible contamination with the bacteria. According to the Food and Drug Administration, 22 illnesses have been reported so far. The eggs were distributed from the farm in Hyde County, North Carolina, and reached consumers in Colorado, Florida, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia through retail stores and restaurants. They were sold under the brand names Country Daybreak; Crystal Farms; Coburn Farms; Sunshine Farms; Glenview; Great Value; as well as at Walmart and Food Lion stores The egg recall is the largest in the United States since 2010, according to Food Safety News. The recall involves eggs with the plant number P-105, with the Julian date range of 011 through 012 printed on either side of the carton or package. Salmonella can cause serious and even deadly infections in children or elderly adults. Symptoms include fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.
