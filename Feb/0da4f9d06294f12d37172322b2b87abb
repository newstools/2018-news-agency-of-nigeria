Willian will put his warmth and respect for Jose Mourinho on hold for Chelsea’s trip to Manchester United today. Mourinho brought Willian to Stamford Bridge in the summer of 2013 and the pair won a domestic cup double together the following season, before Mourinho left Chelsea by mutual consent at the end of 2015. Willian says he will put his affection for Mourinho to one side as Chelsea aim to keep their Champions League qualification hopes alive. “I had great memories with him [Mourinho],” the Brazilian told Sky Sports. “He was a great, great manager for me, and I think not only for me – also for Chelsea for the fans. “But now I am still at Chelsea and he is in Manchester and I have to look to my side. Of course, we are friends but when you go onto the pitch you have to do your job. “It’s a massive game on Sunday and we are looking forward to it. We expect, of course, a difficult game. To play there is not easy. We know that and I think we now have to stay at the same level we played at when we played Barcelona.”
