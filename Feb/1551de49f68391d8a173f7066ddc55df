 Despite all the controversies generated by Olamide’s hit single, Science Student, the official video of the song was quietly released on Sunday on You Tube on Vevo label. The video is already stirring controversy afresh, trending as number 3 on You Tube in Nigeria. It has within 24 hours garnered close to 85,000 views, with 294 dislikes and over 5,000 likes. The video opens on a note of drama, with Olamide being abandoned by friends in a dumpsite. The rapper is seen alone wading through the place, prodded by a woman with fire in her eyes. The symbolism is telling immediately, afterall this is a song about drug addiction. The woman leads him to a disused building, filled with drug addicts, smoke and drug chemicals. The video ends with Olamide in a choreography  with scores of people and if you wonder, about the relevance of the pulsating steps, you get the answer when the video signs off with ”Say No To Drugs”. Kaffy is behind the creative direction of the clips while the video was shot and directed by Unlimited L.A.
