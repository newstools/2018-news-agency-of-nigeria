The President, Nigeria Youth Organisation(NYO), Abdullahi Wali, says he will sue President Muhammadu Buhari if he refuses to contest in  the 2019 presidential election. Wali, in a statement made available to newsmen on Monday in Abuja, said he was reacting to a statement credited to Buhari during a meeting with APC governors. He said that the president was quoted as saying that he needed time to decide whether he would run or not. Wali said President Buhari should run in 2019 in order to consolidate the achievements he had recorded so far. He listed some Buhari’s achievements as effective implementation of Treasury Single Account(TSA), diversification of the economy, anti-corruption war, war against insurgency, the complete refund of Paris club loan deduction to states among others. “If Buhari decides not to run in 2019, the achievements recorded by his administration will vanish as the vampires of our common treasury will resurrect and loot everything leaving the masses with nothing. “Therefore, he needs to solidify his achievement before handing over to hopefully a youth. “NYO agenda is to build Nigerian youths to actively participate in leadership for national unity and development and will therefore not sit and watch the solid foundation made by this administration for the benefit of Nigerian youths sink. “ I have directed my lawyers to sue the president if he refuses to run and will also mobilise millions of youths under my leadership to stage the highest rally ever in Nigeria until the president accepts to run,’’ he said. Wali said that he would be glad to beg the president for the privilege of purchasing a nomination form for him if he decided to run in 2019.
