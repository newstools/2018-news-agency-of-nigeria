His ‘Evangelists: Cymbal, Triangle and Tambourine’ done in 1964, was sold for £56,250. Bonhams says  on its website that  Ben Enwonwu’s portraits of Tutu have achieved a high level  of celebrity because the paintings were some of the most enigmatic works produced by a Nigerian artist in the 20th century. In 1971, Enwonwu, who died in1994, at the age of 77,  was appointed the first professor of Fine Art at the University of Ife. “The violence of the Nigerian/Biafran conflict (1967-1970) was still fresh in public consciousness, and academic institutions were tasked with promoting a spirit of national reconciliation. Enwonwu embraced this duty, using Negritude ideology and imagery to explore issues of cultural identity and political contestation that the Nigerian civil war had laid bare. The artist created a number of his most famous works during this period, including three portraits – all titled Tutu – of a young Yoruba woman named Adetutu Ademiluyi, a granddaughter of a previous Ooni (king) of Ife. “Enwonwu frequently made trips to the countryside surrounding Ife, sketching the landscape and recording cultural traditions and practices. It was during one of these visits that he encountered Tutu. He was so impressed by her beauty and unusual features that he asked her parents for permission to paint her. Enwonwu may have also been motivated by her status as a royal princess of Ife – he was also of royal lineage, descended from the Umuezearoli of Onitsha. In addition, winning the approval of the Ife royal house would offer the artist protection from any problems arising from his Igbo ethnicity, a contentious issue in post-war Nigeria.”
