Church leaders closed Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Sunday in protest against Israeli taxation and land policy affecting church property. Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian Church leaders said the holy site, where many Christians believe Jesus was crucified and buried, would be closed until further notice. A statement by the leaders accused Israel of a “systematic and unprecedented attack against Christians in the Holy Land” in pursuing a new tax policy and a proposed land appropriation law.(Reuters/NAN)
