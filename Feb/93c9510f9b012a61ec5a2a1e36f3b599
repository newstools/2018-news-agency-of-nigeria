By Anita Eboigbe Tobi Bakre has emerged the new Head of House in the ongoing Big Brother Naija ‘Double Wahala’, beating housemates Miracle, Anto and Cee-C to win the title for the third time. In addition to his win, Tobi also gets to enjoy the luxury room with his strategic partner, Alex. Tobi won the title in the first and second week while he was still paired with Cee-C. However, there were no evictions during his previous reign, so he did not get to use his power, which allows him to save a nominated pair and replace with another. During his previous tenures as the HoH, the housemates lost their wager. Tobi had come under fire for his relationship with former strategic partner Cee-C, whom viewers described as `toxic and controlling.’ Cee-C’s hold on Tobi triggered negative reactions from viewers who called for prayers to free him form Cee-C’s alleged manipulation.  The hastag #PrayforTobi became the trending topic on various social media. It seems viewers prayers’ were answered when `Biggie’, owner of the BBNaija house changed the pair during the reshuffling in the house, leaving Cee-C to be paired with Lolu while Tobi was paired with Alex. Tobi’s win comes after Miracle’s successful reign as the Head of House. This season tagged ‘Double Wahala’, housemates are competing for prizes worth 45 million naira. (NAN)
