The nationals of Australia, New Zealand and Timor-Leste will also be granted the Angolan visa on arrival. Africa Review quotes Rádio Nacional de Angola (RNA) as saying that the visitors will only need to submit their accommodation and subsistence means to get the tourism visa in Luanda. The international certificate of vaccination, a return ticket and a valid passport will also be required for the granting of the 30 days visa. The presidential decree, RNA added, will be in force from March 30. An invitation letter, which will no longer be a condition for visa application, was a handicap for many tourists wishing to visit Angola. The Angolan government says that the tourism sector will create one million jobs by 2020. Angola’s tourism industry is relatively new because much of the country was destroyed during the post-colonial civil war, which ended in 2002 The tourism sector is mainly private and its development and expansion will greatly diversify the country’s economy.
