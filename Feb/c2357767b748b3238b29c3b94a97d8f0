The Nadi Declaration was adopted at the final session of the 20th Conference of Commonwealth Education Ministers (20CCEM), held in Nadi, Fiji. The Declaration, which was adopted on Feb. 23, outlined the priorities and agenda for education across the Commonwealth for the next three years (2018 – 2021). Building on the outcomes of the 19CCEM, ministers reaffirmed that education is a fundamental human right and is indispensable for achieving sustainable development. They expressed a commitment to ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and to promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all. Ministers recognised the valuable service provided by the Commonwealth of Learning (COL) over the last 30 years. They appreciated COL’s focus on promoting learning for sustainable development through the use of technologies and for its emphasis on lifelong learning for employment, entrepreneurship and empowerment, all of which support the ongoing efforts of Member States to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 4. COL was commended for the growing impact of the Virtual University for Small States of the Commonwealth (VUSSC) in strengthening tertiary education in small states and for its global leadership in open educational resources (OER) and innovation in educational technologies. Prof. Asha kanwar, COL President and Chief Executive Officer, said “COL will work in partnership with sister organisations and stakeholders in the field to ensure that development outcomes are not just achieved but exceeded.”
