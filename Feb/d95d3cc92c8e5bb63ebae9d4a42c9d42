By Victor Adeoti An Osun High Court sitting in Osogbo on Friday sentenced a 45-year-old man, Moshood Babatunde, to 11 years imprisonment for unlawful possession of a human head. Babatunde, who was arrested on Oct. 13, 2011, had been charged with unlawful possession of human skull, indecent display of human corpse, sale of human parts and use of human parts for charms. Justice Kudirat Akano, while delivering her judgment, sentenced Babatunde to seven years imprisonment on the first charge, two years for the second charge, and another two years for the third charge. The judge said that she was convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offence in view of the massive evidence presented by the prosecution counsel. Akano, however, said that the sentences would run concurrently. The Osun Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Dr. Ajibola Bashiru, who arraigned the suspects, had told the court that Babatunde was arrested on Oct. 13 for committing the crime. Bashiru said that the offences were contrary to Sections 516, 242(1)(b), 329A(1) and 242 (b) of the Criminal Code Law, Cap.34, Volume. II, Laws of Osun State, 2002.
