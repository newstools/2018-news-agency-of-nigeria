Tennis legend, Serena Williams will restart her tennis career on Monday at the BNP Paribas Open in Palm Springs California, but her husband, Alexis Ohanian has lined up  four billboards as a surprise for her. The billboards, erected alongside Interstate 10 are meant to celebrate her return to competitive tennis. And it would appear Alexis designed them with the help of daughter Olympia.  The signs celebrate Williams as the “G.M.O.A.T.,” which one would assume means “Greatest Mother of All Time.” All four feature photos of the couple’s daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. The BNP Paribas Open commences Monday at Indian Wells Tennis Garden in Palm Springs.
