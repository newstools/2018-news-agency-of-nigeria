By Ijeoma Okigbo/Abolade Ogundimu The Nigeria Shooting Federation (NSF) says it is making plans to host the International Shooting Sports Federation (ISSF) summit in April. The federation’s President, Lonsdale Adeoye, said this on Wednesday in Abuja on the sidelines of the maiden NSF media workshop and competition. Adeoye said the federation was making arrangements to secure sponsors who would partner with the board as well as consultants to assist in the preparations. Adeoye, a retired Brigadier-General, added that the country had the right to host the ECOWAS shooting championships also. “We will be hosting the ISSF summit as well as the ECOWAS shooting championships. This is how we can be recognised more by the international body. “We have over two million able-bodied young people in this country, so why can’t we win medals in shooting which has about 38 events. “We have players here who can surpass the commonwealth records, so I have no doubt that we can excel in whatever event our athletes feature in,’’ he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that about 40 sports journalists from across the country are taking part in the training from Feb. 20 to Feb. 22 in Abuja.
