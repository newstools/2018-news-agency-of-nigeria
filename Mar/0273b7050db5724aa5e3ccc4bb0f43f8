Bayern Munich’s goal poacher, Robert Lewandowski is set to force his way out of the club in the summer and join Real Madrid. The Poland international is desperate for a new challenge and hired super-agent Pini Zahavi who has met with potential clubs in the recent months. According to Mundo Deportivo, the 29-year-old will sign a two-year contract with Madrid, picking up a healthy wage bump with the option of extending the deal for a further year. Despite agreeing personal terms with Real Madrid, Bayern Munich are still resisting transfer talk involving their star goal scorer. The Bayern forward is still under contract at the club until the summer of 2021 and will have to persuade the Bundesliga giants to let him leave in the summer. Lewandowski who has won five German league title  in his eight years in Germany has scored 142 goals in just 184 appearances for Bayern Munich. The Polish skipper is attracted by the fact that he will be spearheading Real Madrid’s attack force if he signs since the current striker Karim Benzema is set to be sold by the Spanish giants after awful season. Reports said Manchester United and Chelsea are also interested in adding the striker in their squads but his agent met with Jose Angel Sanchez and agreed with the Real Madrid terms
