The Kogi State Police Command has denied reports that nine persons including a traditional ruler were killed in Agbenema, Omala Local Government area of the state by herdsmen. The Police said the report was the figment of the imagination of its authors who failed to find out the truth before rushing to press. “The report is not only false, it is mischievous aimed at disturbing the peace in the State”, said the ASP William Ovye Aya, the public relations officer. Aya confirmed the attack on the village by herdsmen on 19 March, but said the traditional ruler of the village was not among the three persons killed. In a previous attack by herdsmen, 12 persons were killed, he said. “The Commissioner of Police urges all peace loving citizens of Kogi State to discountenance such false information and instead gravitate towards issues that unite them”, Aya said. According to the police spokesman, the Command has deployed a Unit of Police Mobile Force, Counter Terrorism Unit, Special Anti-Robbery Squad as well as the conventional Police personnel to the area to restore normalcy. The police commissioner urged mediamen and bloggers to strive always to find out the the true state of incidents and get confirmation from the Police before publishing the stories, so as not to misinform the general public and create mistrust among the people of the State. Earlier reports about the attacks on the community claimed the traditional ruler, the Onu Okewn-Agbenema , Musa Edibo, and his wife were burnt by suspected herdsmen. Also, 100 homes were reportedly razed by the attackers and nine people killed in Agbemena, Iyade village, Aj’Ichekpa and Opada, all in Omala local council.
