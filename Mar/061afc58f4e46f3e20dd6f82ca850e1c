By Ijeoma Okigbo Tony Asuquo, an International Federation of Gymnastics (FIG) certified coach, has abandoned Nigeria following his decision to join an Ethiopian club. Asuquo said he left Nigeria for Ethiopia because he was sure he was not respected and loved by his country. The coach, who is on a six-month deal contract with the Ethiopian gymnastics club, said he opted for the East African side because he felt unappreciated by his country. “I am not comfortable with events happening in the Gymnastics Federation of Nigeria (GFN) where I am a board member,’’ Asuquo told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). The aesthetics and aerobic gymnastics expert said he had just finished the medical session with the club and would be on a six-month renewable contract from August this year. “It is just a pity that my efforts and wealth of experience are not appreciated in Nigeria, but I prefer to work for Nigeria,’’ Asuquo who did not disclose the name of his new club “owing to personal reasons’’ said.
