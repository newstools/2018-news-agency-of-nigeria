Billionaire oil mogul, Femi Otedola has set the social media on fire, in a video he posted last night, dancing with his daughters, to Davidoâ€™s hit song, Omo Baba Lowo. Otedola, who joined Instagram on 9 February this year, to stem fake accounts, now has close to 90,000 followers and his latest video has attracted 104,000 views and over 1200 comments.
