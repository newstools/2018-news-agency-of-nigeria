By Chukwuemeka Opara Gov. David Umahi of Ebonyi, did the unthinkable on Thursday by ordering the arrest of government officials from two warring communities in Ikwo Local Government Area for their alleged involvement in crisis in the area. Umahi gave the order on Thursday in Abakaliki during an enlarged security meeting convened on the resurged communal clash between Ekpomaka and Inyimegu communities of the area which claimed lives and destruction of property. The governor, who was livid with rage, ordered the Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr Titus Lamorde to arrest his Deputy Chief of Staff, Prof. Fidelis Okpata, traditional rulers and government officials present at the meeting who were suspected to have a hand in the crisis. He also ordered the arrest of those who were not present at the meeting including Chief Frederick Udogu, the Chairman of Abakaliki Capital Territory Development Board, and Coordinator of Ikwo South Development Centre, Eso Udogu. Umahi also directed the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Cletus Ofoke to obtain a court order to detain them. “They should remain in detention until they sign an undertaking that no further life would be lost or property destroyed in both communities. “I don’t mind losing all the votes from the areas but I will not keep quiet and watch people die unnecessarily and properties destroyed due to irrelevant issues,” he said. He ordered his Aide-de-Camp to lock all the doors of the state executive council chamber to prevent the affected persons from leaving the chambers. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the CP and other top police officers inside the chamber immediately effected the arrest of the affected persons.
