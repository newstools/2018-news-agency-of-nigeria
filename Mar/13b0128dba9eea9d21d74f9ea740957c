Defending US Open champion Sloane Stephens battled past big-hitting Jelena Ostapenko to claim the Miami Open title in straight sets, 7-6(5), 6-1. Ostapenko, who is the reigning French Open Champion came into the match without having dropped a set or lost a tiebreak during the entire Miami fortnight, but both streaks came to an end in the hands of Stephens. The victory will be even sweeter for Stephens come Monday as she’ll make her long-awaited Top 10 debut,  landing at World No.9.
