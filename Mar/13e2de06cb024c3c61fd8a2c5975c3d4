Juventus qualified for the Champions League quarter-finals on Wednesday after a 2-1 win away to Tottenham Hotspur in their last 16 second leg. Son Heung-Min had put Spurs ahead on the night, six minutes before half-time at Wembley, after the clubs drew 2-2 in the first leg in Italy last month. However, Gonzalo Higuain levelled the scores in the 64th minute and Paulo Dybala won it three minutes later, securing a 4-3 aggregate victory for the Italians. Manchester City have also qualified  for the quarter-finals despite recording a shock 1-2 loss at home to visiting Swiss team  Basel. The loss by City was by a much-changed side and they could afford the luxury as the hard work had been done in Switzerland, three weeks ago. Nonetheless, they  cruised through 5-2 on aggregate. City had extended their aggregate advantage early on when Gabriel Jesus tapped home after just eight minutes. However, Mohamed Elyounoussi exposed some slack City defending to smash in an equaliser for the Swiss champions nine minutes later before Michael Lang rocketed home a spectacular winner 19 minutes from time.  However, a minute later Basel were level as Blas Riveros burst down the left and his deflected cross was dispatched powerfully past Claudio Bravo by Elyounoussi. The Norwegian then had a great chance to put Basel in front on the half hour mark when he miscued horribly wide with just Bravo to beat after outmuscling Danilo. City coach Pep Guardiola grew visibly frustrated on the touchline as his side also started the second period slowly. And they were punished when Elyounoussi’s low cross was blasted past Bravo at his near post from a narrow angle by Lang. Substitute Brahim Diaz came closest to a reply but his low driven effort was turned behind by Vaclik to consign City to a first home defeat since December 2016.
