  Florida lawmakers have voted to enact new gun control measures, weeks after one of the worst school shootings in US history took place in the state. The Senate narrowly passed a bill that would raise the age to buy a firearm from 18 to 21 and require a three-day waiting period for most weapons. Senators voted 20-18 in favour, after an amendment removed a provision to arm classroom teachers. The law now requires approval from the House of Representatives and governor. Seventeen people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Florida city of Parkland on 14 February by former student Nikolas Cruz. Many of the surviving students had called on politicians do more than give “thoughts and prayers” and protested for greater gun control. The national minimum age to buy a handgun is already 21, with a three-day waiting period. However, a person can be as young as 18 to buy a rifle in Florida, with no waiting period.
