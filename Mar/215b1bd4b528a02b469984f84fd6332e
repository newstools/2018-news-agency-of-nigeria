Schalke 04 beat 10-man Freiburg 2-0 on Saturday to delay Bayern Munich’s title celebrations by at least another week and tighten their grip on second place with six games left of the season. Daniel Caligiuri’s controversial 63rd-minute penalty put the hosts ahead and Guido Burgstaller slotted in their second goal 10 minutes later as Schalke earned their sixth win in a row. Minutes earlier Freiburg’s Nils Petersen was sent off after a second booking and coach Christian Streich got his marching orders — and a seat in the stands — for dissent. Schalke are now 17 points behind leaders Bayern, who are on 69 after walloping  third-placed Borussia Dortmund 6-0 on Saturday. But even a win would not be enough for them to secure their sixth straight league title this weekend. RB Leipzig worked their way back into Champions League contention with a nervous 3-2 victory at Hanover 96. The victory lifted them to 46 points and fourth place, a point ahead of Bayer Leverkusen, who managed only a goalless draw against Augsburg. The top four teams qualify automatically for the Champions League group stage next season.
