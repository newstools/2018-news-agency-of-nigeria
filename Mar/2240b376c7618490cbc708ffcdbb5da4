Disney will in the 2019 summer launch its Cruise Line, the first-ever round trip cruise route starting from the port of Civitavecchia, a town near Rome, Italy. Disney fans will be able to see Italy and Southern Europe in a more magical way than ever before. The first voyage begins on June 14 with stops in Italy, France and Spain. Guests will be able to visit Salerno, on Italy’s Amalfi Coast; La Spezia, a common launch point for visiting the picturesque towns of Cinque Terre; Villefranche-sur-Mer and Marseilles, on the French Riviera; and Spain’s vibrant beach city of Barcelona. The Rome-based cruise is just one of seven new cruise routes that Disney has to offer in Europe. The others are Cartagena, Spain; Toulon (Provence) and Brest, France; Belfast, Northern Ireland; Gothenburg and Nynashamn (Stockholm), Sweden; and Fredericia, Denmark, according to the Disney Parks Blog. We dare you not to sing “It’s A Small World After All.” And closer to home for Americans, Disney Cruise Line is also returning to their popular ports in Alaska, the Bahamas and the Caribbean.
