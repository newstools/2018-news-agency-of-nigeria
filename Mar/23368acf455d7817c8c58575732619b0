He said that with the support of all stakeholders, Tinubu would resolve all the intra-party feuds in APC, saying it was a milestone to have Tinubu leading such committee. Okatahi said that as part of effort to contribute toward the success of the reconciliatory team, APC youths had shortlisted names of some stakeholders in the party that they would visit and solicit their support. He said that the youth had identified Arzika, as one of the party’s stakeholders that supported any move effort toward enhancing unity in APC.
