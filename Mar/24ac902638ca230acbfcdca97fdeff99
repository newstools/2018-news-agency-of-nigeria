 Twenty Kenyans were among more than 100 people who were deported from the US over immigration issues. The rest of the people are of Somali and Sudanese origin. Police and immigration officials said a private plane carrying the 114 individuals landed at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport Friday morning. The deportations had been anticipated given the ongoing operations in the USA targeting illegal immigrants. They arrived aboard an Omni International Airlines, a private airline. It landed at JKIA shortly after 10 am on Friday and was received by police and immigration officials. The Kenyans were allowed to proceed to their homes, the 60 Somalis remained in the plane before it took off to Mogadishu while the 24 south Sudanese nationals left in a Juba airline. This is the latest batch of immigrants to be deported from the US in two years under President Donald Trump.
