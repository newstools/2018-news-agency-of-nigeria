By Aderogba George Justice Yusuf Halilu of the FCT High Court, Jabi, on Wednesday granted bail to Maryam Sanda, who allegedly killed her husband, Bilyaminu Bello on Nov. 19, 2017. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that Bilyaminu was the son of Haliru Bello, former National Chairman of PDP. The judge granted the bail following a new motion filed before the court by her counsel, Mr Joseph Daudu (SAN). Halilu ordered Sanda to produce two  sureties who must reside within the court’s jurisdiction and must have a landed property in the FCT. The judge also ordered that the biological father of the defendant must sign an undertaking with the court to produce her on demand at every court sitting. Halilu adjourned the case until March 19 for hearing. In the motion, Dauda asked the court to consider the present health challenge of the defendant. He prayed the court to grant her bail, as the defendant’s health had deteriorated drastically since her arrest and detention on   Nov.19. The counsel also said that the Suleja Prison where the defendant was kept has no adequate medical facilities to take care of her health challenge. He also drew the court’s attention that the defendant is pregnant and also carrying a nine-month old baby. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the defendant was first arraigned in November 2017 for alleged culpable homicide and conspiracy alongside her mother, Mrs Maimuna Aliyu. Others are Aliyu Sanda, the brother and their housemaid Sadiya Aminu. NAN also reports that the three others were granted bail on Dec. 14, 2017, but Maryam was denied bail and remanded in Suleja Prison.
