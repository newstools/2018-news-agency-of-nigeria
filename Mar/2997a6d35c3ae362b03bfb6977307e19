 Japanese star Naomi Osaka trounced world number one Romania’s Simona Halep 6-3 6-0 in just 64 minutes to set up a final match at Indian Wells with Russian rising star, Daria Kasatkina. Both players are 20 years-old and may have signalled the readiness of the younger generation to topple tennis Old order. Halep is 26 years old. Kasatkina had earlier beaten veteran 37 year-old Venus Williams in three sets to qualify for the final, her biggest feat ever. She endured Venus’s fighting spirit in 2 hours 48 minutes. Qualifying for the final at the BNP Paribas Open is also Naomi’s biggest career feat.
