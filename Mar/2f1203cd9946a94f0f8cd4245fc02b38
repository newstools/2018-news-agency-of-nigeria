By Franca Ofili Dr Noel Akpata, Chief Executive Officer of Project Termite Action, said it would empower  more than 100,000 innovators with actionable solutions to socio-economic development in the country. He said empowerment would be part of activities to mark  the World Creativity and Innovation Day. Akpata said this during a courtesy call to Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment, Hajia Aisha Abubakar, in Abuja. ‘‘The visit is geared towards the celebration of World Innovation and Creativity Day on April 21. ‘‘We are launching Project Termite Action and Ideas  World Cup, a brainstorming series of activities to help Nigerians see the nation in a better light and come up with actionable solutions  to socio-economic development,’’ he said. The day was founded to encourage people to use new ideas, make new decisions, take new actions and achieve new outcomes that make the world a better place. According to him, the group will use its network to ensure that funding will not hinder the innovators from achieving their objectives. Akpata said it would collaborate with the ministry to transform Nigeria through creativity and innovation. Abubakar pledged to support the group, saying that Nigeria was far behind and needed innovation to solve lot of problems. She said the idea, if properly executed, would put Nigeria on same page with other countries with innovations. ‘‘The country needs an environment where we can have a proper synergy because we have a huge gap in the area of innovation,’’ Abubakar said.
