Australia’s Kokkinakis Thanasi, ranked 177th in the world has shocked World No 1 Roger Federer in Miami Masters, where Federer was the defending champion. The 21 year-old player recorded his biggest career win in the second round of the Miami Masters, when he outplayed out-of-sort Swiss megastar in three sets, winning 3-6 6-3 7-6. The loss will also make Federer lose his crown to Rafael Nadal, as Federer stands to lose points when the next ranking is announced. It was Kokkinakis first victory over a World No. 1 and he came from a set down to stun Federer. It marked just the second time Federer has lost to someone as low as Kokkinakis in 18 years, and the first time the Swiss has dropped consecutive matches since 2014. He was coming off another defeat in a deciding tie-break, having fallen to Juan Martin del Potro in the BNP Paribas Open final on Sunday. Kokkinakis became the lowest-ranked player to defeat a World No. 1 since World No. 178 Francisco Clavet upset Lleyton Hewitt in Miami 2003. On the comeback trail after a bevy of injuries derailed his finish to 2017 and start to 2018, Kokkinakis would show no signs of rust. Groin and pectoral strains were followed by a rolled ankle at an ATP Challenger Tour event in Mexico less than a month ago, but with his movement crisp and forehand flowing, he refused to succumb in front of a packed crowd on Stadium court. Asked about his winning strategy against Federer, Kokkinakis said: “You go there to win. You’re not going to go there, thinking, ‘I hope I get a few games.’ That’s just not the attitude you need.” *With reports by ATP Tennis
