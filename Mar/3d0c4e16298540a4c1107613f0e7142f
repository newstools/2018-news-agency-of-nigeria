 Peter Koo, a New York Democrat councilman says he is proposing a law that will ban people from smoking while walking. He said Under the plan anyone found lighting up while on the move on the city’s streets would be fined $50. Koo added that he would introduce the  bill this week. He said: “My bill is very simple, no smoking and walking on New York City sidewalks.” New Yorkers would be allowed to stand in one place while they smoke. The theory behind the proposed ban is that smokers subject more people to passive smoke if they walk. Mr Koo said: “This bill is not against smoking, just don’t do both together.” The city has already banned smoking in most restaurants and bars, offices, and public venues including parks. Ceia Cremo, 48, who was smoking as she walked down Fifth Avenue, told the New York Daily News: “I think it’s unreasonable. Where else do I have left to smoke? You can’t smoke in the park, you can’t smoke in a lot of places.” Another New York smoker told Fox5: “I’m not standing in one spot. It’s not gonna happen. “As I’m walking, it’s outside, I’m not blowing it in anyone’s face.” Source:https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/21/new-york-considers-plan-ban-smoking-walking/
