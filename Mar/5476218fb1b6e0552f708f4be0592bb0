Arsenal were  comfortable 3-0 winners over Watford at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday to snap a run of three straight Premier League defeats and also keep doubters silent for some time. Victory over Watford was Arsenal’s first Premier League win for five weeks. Former Borussia Dortmund duo Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Henrikh Mkhitaryan again showed their fine relationship for the Gunners by teeing each other up to score in the second half after Shkodran Mustafi had headed the hosts into the lead in the eighth minute. Watford could have got back into the game at 2-0, but Troy Deeney saw his penalty saved by Petr Cech. That was a sweet moment for the home fans, as Deeney had questioned Arsenal’s heart when the Hornets won the corresponding fixture in October. “We have had a disappointing period and our supporters suffered like we suffered,” said Wenger. “But our job is to perform and stick together in important moments and get the fans back on side.” It was the first spot-kick the Czech ‘keeper had saved in three years with Arsenal and it ensured he also became the first man to register 200 clean sheets in the Premier League. “It is an unbelievable personal milestone, but the most important thing is to win and so it was defeats that were more frustrating,” said Cech.
