He told students of Government Girls Secondary School, Damaturu, Yobe that the new measure would provide students with security and enable them to pursue their studies and realise their dreams. “We will deploy additional policemen to the schools to see to your welfare, safety and security. “They will be here 24 hours and I want you to cooperate with them, give them information on strange faces and movements for maximum security,” he said.
