Thousands of women, clad in white, marched in the Guinean capital of Conakry to protest against violent crackdown on political demonstrations by the police The protests are a reaction to the elections last month, Africareview reports. Around 5,000 women, dressed in the local colour of mourning, took part in the Wednesday’s three-kilometre march, but organisers put the turnout at 10,000. They carried banners reading, “Too many deaths — the state is still asleep” and “Alpha rhymes with crime,” a reference to the president of the West African state, Alpha Conde. Around a dozen people have died in political unrest since early February, some of whom were shot dead by police. Protests erupted after elections on February 4, the country’s first at local level since 2005. According to official results contested by the UFDG opposition, the ballot was won by Conde’s party, the Rally for the Guinean People
