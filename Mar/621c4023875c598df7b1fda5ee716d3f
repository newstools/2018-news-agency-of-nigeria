Nabilu Balarabe The Police Command in Taraba has confirmed that five people were killed and several others injured in fresh attacks on Fulani communities by suspected Mambilla militia in Sardauna local government area of the state. The state’s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP David Misal, disclosed this to  the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday. He said that the crisis erupted in Nyiwa and Yerimaru areas on Thursday as a result of a misunderstanding between a farmer and a herder.
