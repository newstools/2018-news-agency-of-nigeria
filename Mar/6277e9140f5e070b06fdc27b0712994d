The All Progressives Congress (APC) has called  on the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to follow the example of one its leaders and former Deputy Senate President, Sen. Ibrahim Mantu. Mantu in a recent TV programme confessed the he took part in rigging elections for the PDP. Now the APC wants the PDP to borrow this example and confess to their sins against the country instead of indulging in name calling. Apparently burdened by guilty conscience, the PDP National Chairman had last week apologised to the nation for the years of misrule that his party had brought to the country. The APC noted this apology but asked the PDP to go a step further and confess to their sins before restitution could be considered. Instead of taking this path to redemption, PDP has engaged in fruitless “you too” accusations and name calling. “This is further evidence that PDP is not ready for repentance and only offered the apology with the hope that Nigerians will grant them amnesty and a short-cut back to power”, said APC’s publicity secretary, Malam Bolaji Abdullahi. “However, now that Senator Mantu has belled the cat, by confessing to how he has helped the PDP to rig elections in the past, we hope that PDP will follow the bold example of the former Senator and confess to their other sins against Nigeria,” Abdullahi said.
