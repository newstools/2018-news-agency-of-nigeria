By Ifeanyi Nwoko Immediate past President of the Senate, Sen. David Mark has showered encomiums on the former President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Chief Olusegun Aremu Obasanjo on his 81st birthday. Sen. Mark in a goodwill message to former President Obasanjo described him as an uncommon patriot who put the interest of the nation first in all he does. Mark said that Obasanjo is the father of modern day Nigeria who has stood firm against all odds to keep the nation one. According to him, “No one is in doubt that Chief Obasanjo has demonstrated steadfastness, uncommon commitment and faith in the Nigerian project. All of us owe him that respect and honour”. Mark added that Obasanjo even after leaving office has continued to champion the cause of a united Nigeria saying that it takes a good conscience and love for fatherland to do so. He prayed that God in His infinite mercies continue to grant Obasanjo good health, wisdom and courage in the years ahead. He however urged Obasanjo to continue to make his wealth of experience and knowledge especially in leadership available for the younger generation of leaders to tap from. He urged Nigerians to emulate the indomitable spirit of Obasanjo in order to faithfully serve the nation, for the good of all.
