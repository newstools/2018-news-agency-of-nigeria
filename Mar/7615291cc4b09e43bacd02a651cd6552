The veteran defender has experienced almost everything in his career – but he was caught short at Ipurua Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane has revealed the cause of Sergio Ramos’ impromptu break during his side’s Saturday clash with Eibar: the defender needed to go to the bathroom. The Frenchman revealed, however, that the 31-year-old defender failed to make it in time. Los Blancos were being held to a 1-1 draw at Ipurua as Cristiano Ronaldo’s opener had been cancelled out by Ivan Ramis when, after 76 minutes, the centre-back left the field of play without explanation. Following the game Zidane revealed: “Ramos sh*t himself a bit, so he went to the bathroom for a moment.” It was a strange situation given the delicate nature of the game when the 149-time capped Spain defender left the field, yet it did the defending Spanish champions little harm in the end as Ronaldo registered again six minutes from time to settle the match. Despite the victory, Zidane’s men remain 12 points shy of league leaders Barcelona and four short of Atletico Madrid, and they have played a game more than both of their rivals.  Source: Goal.com
