On Friday, it was reported that rapper and music mogul Rick Ross was rushed to the hospital following a possible heart attack of complications from pneumonia. Ross had supposedly been found unresponsive in his home and was placed on an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine (which is used to aid in heart and lung functions), though his friend Fat Trel denied that Ross was on “life support” and a family member claimed he hadn’t been hospitalized at all. Now, TMZ is reporting that Ross has been released from the hospital and that he’s “receiving care at his residence.” Despite the denials about the severity of whatever was going on, TMZ maintains that Ross was having “respiratory issues” that “turned out to be heart-related.” As noted by Entertainment Weekly, Ross has a history of seizures and had recently begun dieting and exercising more often in the last few years.
