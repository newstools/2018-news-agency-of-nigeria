Whitening toothpaste Whitening toothpaste may help reduce yellowing of the teeth and improve whiteness. These products contain stronger ingredients than standard toothpaste, helping to remove tough food stains. Whitening toothpaste does not contain bleach but may contain a small amount of carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide. These chemicals help to lighten tooth color. According to a 2014 study, whitening toothpaste typically lightens tooth color by one or two shades. Some dentists offer tray-based tooth whitening, but home versions are also available over-the-counter. Tray-based tooth whiteners can lighten the teeth by one or two shades. This tooth whitening method involves wearing a fitted tray over the teeth. The tray contains a bleaching gel and is worn for 2 to 4 hours a day or overnight. It is important to look for products that contain 10 percent carbamide peroxide. These are recommended as safe by the American Dental Association (ADA). Whitening strips deliver a thin layer of peroxide gel on plastic strips. These are shaped to fit onto the surface of the teeth. There is a range of whitening strip products available online and instructions for them vary. Most suggest they should be applied twice a day for 30 minutes. Strips can lighten the teeth by one or two shades. That said, a 2016 study notes there is no evidence whitening strips are any more effective than 10 percent carbamide peroxide gel. The use of carbamide peroxide gel is the ADA recommended method. Whitening rinses are another way to get rid of yellow teeth. They contain oxygen sources such as hydrogen peroxide. These react with the compounds staining the teeth, helping to lift them. Using a rinse twice a day for 1 minute at a time can lead to a one to two shade improvement in tooth color within 3 months. Toothpaste that contains activated charcoal may help to reduce staining on the teeth. A 2017 review found that charcoal toothpastes may help remove external staining on teeth. Further studies are needed into the extent or rate of stain removal that can be expected. Charcoal toothpastes should be used with caution, as they can cause staining. The charcoal may be hard to remove from the crevices of the teeth and around restorations. Using a toothpaste containing baking soda and hydrogen peroxide may help reduce yellowing of the teeth. It is possible to make a paste at home by mixing 1 tablespoon of baking soda with 2 tablespoons of hydrogen peroxide. A 2012 study found that using a toothpaste containing baking soda and hydrogen peroxide reduces tooth staining and improves whiteness. A 2007 study found that vitamin C deficiency may worsen peridontitis, which is a buildup of bacteria on the teeth and gums. This buildup contributes to discolouration. It follows that keeping topped up on vitamin C may reduce discolouration of the teeth. More research is needed into whether vitamin C consumption may have a whitening effect on the teeth. When added to toothpaste, certain fruit enzymes may combat discolouration. A 2012 study found toothpaste that contains papain enzyme from the papaya fruit and bromelain enzyme from pineapples helps remove tooth stains. When it is used in small quantities, apple cider vinegar may reduce staining on the teeth and improve whiteness. A 2014 study found that apple cider vinegar has a whitening effect on teeth. It should be noted, however, that this was a study on animals. Apple cider vinegar may damage the surface of the teeth if used too often. More research is needed into the use of apple cider vinegar, as a tooth whitener. In the meantime, it should be used sparingly and with caution. A 2015 study found that oil pulling or swishing in the mouth with coconut oil could be an effective way to reduce plaque buildup on the teeth. As plaque buildup can contribute to yellowing, it follows that coconut oil pulling may reduce discoloration. More research is needed into coconut oil pulling to establish the extent to which it may help whiten the teeth.
