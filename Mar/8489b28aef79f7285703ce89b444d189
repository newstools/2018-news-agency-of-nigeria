Rivers state has commissioned Tax Management (RIVTAMIS) and issuance of Tax Identification Number (RIVTIN) as policies to eliminate difficulty in doing business. Governor Nyesom Wike launched the tax policies in Port Harcourt aimed at averting multiple taxation. He noted that the policies were for the ease of doing business in Rivers. Wike stressed that the new tax reform packages would identify all formal and informal businesses in the state to help the government in planning for development. He noted that with the digital platforms, tax payments could be made from anywhere. “From first April 2018, all businesses are required to obtain their RIVTIN to pay taxes, levies and fines to the Rivers State Government. “All banks have been mobilised to generate RIVTIN for all those who want to make payments to the Rivers State Government, any business that fails to by June 1, 2018 will be appropriately sanctioned,” Wike said. The governor received the first RIVTIN Card from the Executive Chairman of Rivers State Internal Revenue Service, Mr Adoage Norteh, on the occasion. Norteh said the tax payment system had been sanitised to check multiple taxation and that the process would facilitate tax payment, self-service and build the revenue of the state. “Right from the comfort of your office, you can obtain your tax clearance certificate and tax exemption,” he noted. The chairman noted that the tax payer had a duty to reciprocate the tax friendliness of the state government. The President of Port Harcourt Chamber of Commerce, Mines and Industry, Mr Emi Membere-Otaji, stated that the business community was satisfied with the innovations that had eliminated multiple taxation. A spokesman for Heritage Bank, Mr Fabian Briggs, promised that the banks would cooperate to ensure that the programme was successful. (NAN)
