There are indications that a device that exploded early Tuesday at a FedEx ground distribution facility in Texas, injuring one person, is linked to a string of bombings that have rocked the state’s capital this month, federal officials said. Schertz Police Lt. Manny Casas told Fox News that a medium-sized box was on the conveyor belt when the explosion occurred. Casas said a woman was treated for a “possible sound injury” and was released. He said the blast happened shortly after midnight. Schertz police couldn’t immediately confirm what was in the package, but law enforcement officials said the medium-sized package contained metal shrapnel and nails and was headed to Austin when it exploded on a conveyor track. The blast drew a large response from state, local and federal law enforcement agencies. Federal agents told the Associated Press the package is likely linked to attacks in Austin. The ATF’s Houston office said it responded to the scene in Schertz. Schertz is located 22 miles east of San Antonio and 73 miles south of Austin. The blast comes a day after authorities in Austin said a “serial bomber” is likely responsible for four explosions in Austin this month, the latest of which injured two people Sunday night after they crossed a trip wire possibly made with fishing line. Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said at a news conference Monday that although the Sunday night bomb was linked to the three previous blasts, the latest bomb showed more sophistication as opposed to the previous three incidents, which involved package bombs left on people’s doorsteps.
