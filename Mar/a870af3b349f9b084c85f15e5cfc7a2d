Israel will for the first time host an official visit by a member of the British royal family when Prince William travels there this summer, it was announced on Thursday. The visit is coming Seventy years after David Ben-Gurion proclaimed the independence of the state of Israel and an end to the British Mandate in Palestine. Prince William, who is second in line to the British throne, will visit Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian territories in the occupied West Bank. No specific date was announced.

The lack of a formal visit has long been a sore point for many Israelis. Some had interpreted it as a snub , a denial of recognition of the legitimacy of Israel — or, perhaps, the result of fear of harming British business interests in Arab countries.
