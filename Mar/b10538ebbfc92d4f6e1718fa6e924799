Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s conservative governing coalition remains on the verge of collapse on Monday after a night of negotiations over legislation to extend military draft exemptions for ultra-Orthodox Jews. The crisis, which could spark early elections, came after ultra-Orthodox parties said they would not support the 2019 state budget unless the draft exemption legislation is approved. Israel’s Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who heads a hawkish secular party, is the leading coalition member against the draft exemptions. Lieberman has said that he would only support legislation that is drafted by a committee of military officials. Report says the crisis comes as Netanyahu faces police allegations of bribery and mounting corruption probes. Opposition politicians and a leading member of the prime minister’s coalition have accused Netanyahu, who is polling strongly of seeking snap elections as a way to bolster his standing in the event of a criminal indictment. Netanyahu has said he wants elections only at the end of this government’s term, November 2019. (dpa/NAN)
