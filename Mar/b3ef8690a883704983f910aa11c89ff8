By Ifeanyi Nwoko President of the Senate, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, on Saturday condoled with former President Olusegun Obasanjo over the death of his father in-law, Dr. Christopher Abebe. Abebe who was the first indigenous Chairman and Managing Director of United Africa Company (UAC), is the father of Obasanjo’s late wife, Stella. Saraki in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yusuph Olaniyonu, in Abuja urged the ex-President, the Abebe family and the Government and people of Edo to take solace in the fact that Abebe lived a life worthy of emulation. He described the late elder statesman as a board room guru and quintessential public servant who carried out his private and public responsibilities diligently and with utmost integrity. He said: “Abebe was not only a technocrat who helped to shape the growth of private enterprise in the country, he contributed immensely to national development through his services as Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Council of three Nigerian Universities.” He prayed to God to grant the departed soul eternal rest and his beloved ones the fortitude to bear the loss.
