The South-South Chiefs and Elders’ Council (Youth Wing) has commended the immediate past Special Adviser on Niger Delta and Coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme(PAP), retired Brig.-Gen. Paul Boroh over his achievements. President Muhammadu Buhari recently relieved Boroh of his appointment. The group, in a statement signed by its President, Mr Christopher Odhoni, said that Boroh left indelible legacies as the chairman of PAP; hence the need for Buhari to give him a higher responsibility He said that the secret behind the success of PAP under Boroh was not farfetched as that could be easily understood from his astute credentials as a peace builder and a grass rooted Niger Deltan. “Instructively, despite Boroh’s military background, he did not resort of the use of force in tackling Niger Delta challenge, but concentrated on redirecting the energies of the youth to meaningful ventures giving them no room for exploration of devious tendencies. “Today, a vast majority of the youth trained under the watch of Boroh are contributing to the food security of the region through innovative agricultural engagements. “Several others have been trained in manufacturing, fabrication, automobile building among others are respectively contributing to the growth of the region, thus giving the administration a good name before the people of the region. “On this note, and in the same vein, we herein call on Buhari to give  Boroh higher responsibility in his administration because we need a creative thinker and a technocrat in the region and the nation as a whole in order to maximally utilise his developmental and peace building strategies which have and will still do much good,’’ he said. He said that the group had consistently thrown her full weight of support behind Buhari’s determined efforts to bring development and inclusive governance to the region.
