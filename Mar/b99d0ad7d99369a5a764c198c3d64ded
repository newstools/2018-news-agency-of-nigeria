  The House of Representatives has lifted the suspension placed on the former Chairman, House Committee on Appropriation, Rep. Abdulmumin Jibrin (Kano-APC). This followed a letter of apology signed by Jibrin which was presented by the Speaker of the House, Mr Yakubu Dogara, at the plenary on Tuesday. Jibrin was suspended in 2017 for 180 legislative days, for allegedly exposing “budget padding” scandal in the legislative arm of government. While presenting the letter, Dogara said that the suspended legislator had met all the conditions necessary for him to resume his duties. Dogara said that the lawmaker was free to resume his legislative duties whenever he so wished.
