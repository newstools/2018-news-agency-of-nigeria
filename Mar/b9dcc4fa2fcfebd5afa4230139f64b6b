A Kenyan opposition politician Miguna Miguna has cried out over his continued detention in a toilet at the country’s main airport for refusing deportation. Miguna had on Wednesday morning posted a statement on social media saying he remained “detained inside a tiny and filthy toilet” in a terminal at Nairobi’s international airport. James Orengo, lawyer for Miguna, said on Wednesday that authorities were in contempt after the High Court on Tuesday ordered his immediate release and a court appearance Wednesday morning. The court ordered that his Kenyan passport be restored and that he be allowed to return. Miguna was deported to Canada last month in a crackdown on politicians who attended the mock inauguration of opposition leader Raila Odinga to protest President Uhuru Kenyatta’s re-election.
