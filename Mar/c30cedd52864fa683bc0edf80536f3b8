The trial of Senate President, Bukola Saraki, at the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) has been adjourned indefinitely. Chairman of the Tribunal, Mr. Danladi Umar, announced the adjournment in a short ruling on the resumption of trial in  Abuja today. He said the tribunal would await the decision of the Supreme Court on the appeals filed by both Saraki and the Federal Government. Saraki is being tried on three of the 18 count-charge  for false declaration of assets. Umar gave the ruling after listening to the addresses of both the defence and prosecuting lawyers. In his address, the prosecuting counsel Mr Rotimi Jacobs urged the Tribunal to proceed with taking the final address from the parties in the suit. He based his request on the fact that the defence had already opened and closed their case and the Tribunal had adjourned for the adoption of final addresses. However, Counsel to the Senate President Mr Kanu Agabi urged the Tribunal to be mindful of the dignity of the Supreme Court and prayed for an indefinite adjournment. Agreeing with the defence counsel, the CCT chairman held that the Tribunal “has decided to tarry awhile so that the integrity of Supreme Court would not be played with.” “The Tribunal will adjourn this matter sine die pending the outcome of the appeals at the Supreme Court,” he added. On Tuesday last week, the Tribunal had adjourned the case till March 8 to hear the final address by the parties in the suit and for its final judgment. The parties will have to await the decisions of the Supreme Court to proceed with the rest of the trial. *Reported by Channels TV
