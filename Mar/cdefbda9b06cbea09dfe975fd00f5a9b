 By Muhammad Adam No fewer than 400,000 primary school pupils will benefit from the Federal Government school feeding programme in Adamawa state, an official has said. Mr Ahmad Abba, the State Director, National Orientation Agency (NOA), made this known  in an  interview with the  News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Yola on Tuesday. Abba said that the benefiting pupils were those from primary one to three. He said that the state government would carter for the feeding of those in class four to six as earlier agreed. “The Federal Government has fixed April 1 to kick off the School Feeding programme in Adamawa. “About 400,000 primary school pupils across the state are expected to benefit in the programme,” Abba said. He explained that during the signing of Memorandum of Understanding between federal and state governments last year, the state government was expected to feed those from primary four to six. According to Abba, the programme is aimed at targeting vulnerable pupils who cannot afford three square meals in a day and also to increase school enrolment. “When the news of free school feeding goes round, even before its commencement, some schools in Yola had already reported massive pupil enrolment. “For example, at Wuro Jabbe primary school, a suburb in Yola, the school management confirmed hundred per cent increase of pupils enrolment,” the state NOA director said.
