American John Isner outplayed Argentine Juan Martin Del Potro 6-1, 7-6(2) to reach his first #MiamiOpen final and fourth career Masters 1000 final. It was the first semi-final match of the day, with the American dominating proceedings and del Potro, playing out-of-sort. Big serving Isner will know his final opponent after the the match between Pablo Carreno and Alexander Zverev later today. The final match will be played on Sunday. As ATPWorldTour.com reported the American did little wrong against Del Potro, who was on a 15-match win streak and leads the ATP World Tour with 21 wins this season. Isner’s serve, as usual, was dominant, but his groundstrokes and volleys carried him to victory. He swung freely and played aggressively on serve and return. The American finished with 39 winners, including 16 aces, to only 10 from Del Potro.  The last time Del Potro lost was more than a month ago, on 23 February against #NextGenATP American Frances Tiafoe at the Delray Beach Open. Since then, the Argentine had captured back-to-back titles in Acapulco and Indian Wells. Del Potro had to save three match points against No. 1 Roger Federer in the BNP Paribas Open final to win his maiden Masters 1000 crown. Isner broke in the third game, pounding Del Potro’s backhand before hitting a forehand volley winner at net. After only 27 minutes, he had a one-set lead, thanks to his 19 winners, compared to zero from his opponent. Del Potro, behind a boisterous Argentine crowd on Key Biscayne, recovered in the second set. But Isner was too strong, too aggressive, too confident. He never faced a break point all match, and in the tie-break, his volleys were the difference. A backhand dropper pushed him into Sunday’s final.
