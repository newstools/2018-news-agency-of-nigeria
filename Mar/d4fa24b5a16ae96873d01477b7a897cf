By Olawale Jokotoye /Abeokuta Former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo said on Monday that   the early death of his parents remains  a major regret in  his life. Obasanjo disclosed this at  his 81st birthday ceremony held at the Marque Events Centre inside  the  Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library Complex in Abeokuta. The former president, who recalled that his parents laboured  to train him,  expressed regrets that they could not live to ” reap  the fruits  of their labour.’’ ” One of the things that I always missed or remember with some feeling of sadness is that my parents left this world too early. “They made a lot of sacrifices for me and I wish they have been around to reap the fruits of their labour,” he said. He said he had always found solace in the belief of the Yoruba  that ” the dead sees what goes on in the land of the living.’’ The elder statesman  said he was sure that his parents would be grateful and happy at his achievements if they had been alive. Obasanjo expressed appreciation to all those  who had worked with him and contributed to making  his life a success. He said he was particularly grateful to all who “lifted his hands” when he got tired in the course of building the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library . ”I would not have ventured into the project if I had known it would be that massive, but I thank you all for supporting me all the way,” he said.
