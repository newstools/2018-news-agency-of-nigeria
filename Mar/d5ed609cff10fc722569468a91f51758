Novak Djokovic is still trying to find his old form as he crashed out of Indian Wells tournament in his first match on Sunday. He lost to 25 year-old qualifier American-born Japanese  Taro Daniel in three sets, 7-6 4-6 6-1. Djokovic had won the tournament five times and came to win the sixth. “For me it felt like (the) first match I ever played on the tour. Very weird. I mean, I just completely lost rhythm,” Djokovic said after the Daniel upset. “I had some inexplicable, uncharacteristic errors,” Djokovic told reporters. “But that’s, I guess, it’s all part of those particular circumstances that I’m in at the moment,” he added. In contrast, Roger Federer is still having ball on the court, as the the 36 year-old  defeated Argentine Federico Delbonis in two sets, 6-3 7-6, in a rain delayed match. Rain on Saturday had delayed the match, with Federer leading 6-3 2-2. Play resumed Sunday evening, with the second set going into tie brake. Delbonis had defeated Federer at an ATP meeting in  Hamburg in 2013, He won 7-6, 7-6. Federer, who regained the world No 1 ranking last month, is on a quest to make history in the California desert by winning an unprecedented sixth Indian Wells title. The 36-year-old Swiss marvel continues to defy the ageing process, claiming his 20th grand slam title and sixth Australian Open crown in January. He has enjoyed a perfect start to 2018 by winning both events he has competed in and taking his career singles title tally to 97. Federer said on Thursday that he won’t be taking anyone for granted in this draw. “I didn’t come here to lose in the first round or two,” he said. “I care about the moment. I care about the results.”
