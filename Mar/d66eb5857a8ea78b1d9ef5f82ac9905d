Amro Marei opened scores in the second minute, while Amine Chermiti added two goals in the third and eighth minutes for the first half to end 3-0 in the hosts’ favour. The 14th minute substitution of goalkeeper Odah Okiemute for Dele Ajiboye seemed to stabilize the visitors’ rear until the hosts scored the fourth goal in the 54th minute.
