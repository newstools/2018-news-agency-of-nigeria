India Thursday successfully flight tested its supersonic BrahMos cruise missile in the western state of Rajasthan, the country’s defence minister said. The missile was flight tested from Pokhran test range in Rajasthan on Thursday morning. Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted: “the precision strike weapon with Indian-made seeker flew in its designated trajectory and hit the target with pin-point accuracy. “The successful test will further bolster our national security.” The land and sea variants of BrahMos supersonic cruise missile are already operational with the Indian army and the Indian navy. In November 2017, India successfully flight tested the air version of BrahMos missile from its fighter jet Sukhoi-30MKI against a sea-based target in the Bay of Bengal. NAN reports that a BRAHMOS is a two-stage missile with a solid propellant booster engine as its first stage which brings it to supersonic speed and then gets separated. It is the world’s fastest anti-ship cruise missile in operation. (Xinhua/NAN)
