By Ikenna Uwadileke Organisers of the annual National Political Summit say that preparations have been concluded for a hitch-free third edition of the programme designed to engage stakeholders on ways to address political challenges confronting the country. Chairman of the Board, Save Nigeria Group, Dr Gregory Ibe, told newsmen in Abuja that the three-day event would provide a platform where various agitations in the country would be discussed. The event scheduled to take place from March 19 to March 21 in Abuja has the theme “Reforming the Nigerian Federation: Which way forward’’. “It is important that we start discussing all the agitations, expectations and challenges facing us as a nation. “There is a lot of heat across the country and people are saying that political solution is required, so there must be a gathering of Nigerians where you bare your mind. “Where political solutions can be discussed and a more refined information that can provide solution to whatever is happening in the country can be presented for government to take action. “It is a platform where all who are interested in moving this country forward can come and vent their anger and document what expectation they have so that we can use it to find solutions,’’ Ibe said. According to him, critical stakeholders have therefore been invited from across the zones of Nigeria to present specific positions on the options for reforming Nigeria. “The national gathering of stakeholders will attract over 3,500 delegates to dialogue on the future of Nigerian political environment. “And to forge partnership and cooperation for the sustainable development of the country,’’ he added.
