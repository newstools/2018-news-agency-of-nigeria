US President Donald Trump has backtracked on raising the minimum age requirement from 18 to 21 for some gun purchases, local media reported on Monday. Trump indicated support for the measure in the wake of February’s massacre at a Florida high school. The latest proposals put forward by the White House instead suggested the establishment of a commission to examine whether the measure would make sense. There was, however, no proposed timeline for the commission. The proposals are much more modest than those Trump suggested he would support in February. Controversially, they do include a plan to help individual states arm teachers on a voluntary basis. The plan is backed by the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA) and opposed by the country’s biggest teacher’s group, the National Education Association. Democrat Sen. Chuck Schumer said in response to the new proposals that the White House has taken tiny baby steps designed not to upset the NRA, when the gun violence epidemic in the country demands that giant steps be taken. “The White House is also supporting improved background checks. “It is also calling on states to introduce measures which would allow law enforcement to confiscate weapons from people deemed to be a danger to themselves or others,’’ Schumer added. A 19-year-old has been charged over the killing of 17 people at a school in Parkland, Florida, in February. The former pupil had legally purchased the weapon used in the attack in spite of having a record of mental health problems and making threats. (dpa/NAN)
