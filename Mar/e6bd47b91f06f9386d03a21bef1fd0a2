  The Living Word Sanctuary Church has taken a mansion which used to belong to former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson. The Masion is to be converted into a church. The Ohio building, which covers 25,000 square feet, was donated to Living Word Sanctuary Church after its previous owner was convicted of money laundering. Paul Monea was imprisoned in 2007 – eight years after he bought the property from Tyson for $1.3m. The swimming pool room had been turned into the main auditorium while the basketball court  turned into a youth centre. Speaking to the Warren Tribune-Chronicle, church pastor Nicholas DeJacimo said: “Us getting this is a miracle. “It was basically donated to us because the former owner needed to write it off. I tell the congregation God literally gave us this.” “He literally gave us a free campus to do whatever we want. We will use it to glorify him.” Work is continuing on the renovation. Once completed church members will move from the local YMCA where they’ve recently been meeting. source:https://www.premierchristianradio.com/News/World/Mike-Tyson-mansion-transformed-into-church
