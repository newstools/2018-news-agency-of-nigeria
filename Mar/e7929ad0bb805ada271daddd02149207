By Stanley Nwanosike Nollywood actor, Kenneth Okonkwo, popularly known as “Andy’’ has declared his interest to run for gubernatorial race in Enugu State on the platform of All Progressives Party (APC) in Enugu state. Okonkwo said at the state APC’s enlarged State Executive Council and stakeholders meeting held at the party’s secretariat in Enugu on Sunday. He told newsmen that he joined the race following calls from his people. The ace actor said he was also moved by the fact that the incumbent, Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, who hails from same Enugu North Senatorial District and Nsukka Cultural Zone, had failed to deliver people-oriented governance to the people. According to him, as it stands today, Gov. Ugwuanyi cannot boast of any enduring legacy in Nsukka land, and that is why I want to unseat him in 2019, so as to provide the needed democracy dividends for our people and state in general. “My people started the move; it is their move. I will be the governor of Enugu State in 2019’’. He also alleged that Ugwuanyi’s administration has a penchant for rehabilitation of roads; pointing out that since inception the government has not embarked on the construction of a brand new road in any parts of the state.
