By Ifeanyi Nwoko Popular entertainment star turned activist, Charley Boy has apologized to President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki over an unverified post to spite the lawmaker. Charley had taken to his tweeter handle @Areafada1 to cast aspersion on the President of the Senate over a picture where Saraki was seen cleaning mud from his trousers. Apparently misled by social media posts, Charley Boy had written: “E never start. Saraki after he escaped the mob attack by people of lafiagi in his own state. May all those who have conspired to render us hopeless, penniless and frustrated, may nemesis catch up with them. However, hours later and upon realizing that the photograph was taken when Saraki led a delegation on an oversight visit to assess the level of oil spillage in Ogoniland in 2012. The entertainment star therefore tendered an unreserved apology to the President of the Senate saying: “APOLOGY TO SENATE PRESIDENT SARAKI My earlier post on Senate president Bukola Saraki was incorrect. I admit I was in a hurry to post before verifying the veracity of the story. I apologize for this avoidable error. Some Nigerians who reacted to the apology commended Charley Boy for the bold step and urged the President of the Senate to accept the apology.
