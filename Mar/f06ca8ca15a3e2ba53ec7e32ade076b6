 By Edith Ike- Eboh Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria, (DAPPMAN) says it has suspended plans to lay off its workers following the N650 billion debt owed it by the Federal Government. DAPPMAN disclosed this in a statement signed by Chairman and Executive Secretary, Mr. Dapo Abiodun and Mr. Olufemi Adewole respectively, on Monday in Abuja. It said the suspension of the ultimatum given the government was after an intervention by the Federal Government, who had also promised to pay off the debts. “Following the 14 day ultimatum to commence staff disengagement given to the Federal Government (FGN) by DAPPMAN in the light of over N650 billion  owed by FGN to petroleum marketers, a series of constructive engagements and meetings were held with NNPC, Ministry of Labour, the Presidency and DAPPMAN/MOMAN. “Marketers have been reassured about the FGN’s commitment to make payment as evidenced by the request for approval for appropriation of same to the National Assembly. “It is our hope that this approval will be given promptly and these long overdue payments made subsequently. “Consequently, DAPPMAN/MOMAN hereby suspend the issued 14 days ultimatum and use this medium to plead with all our staff under the various umbrella Unions: NARTO, PENGASSAN, NUPENG/PTD to please bear with us whilst this approval for appropriation by the NASS is being deliberated on and processed, which we believe will not exceed two weeks in view of the adverse implications of any delays. “All marketers are to ensure there is no disruption in the supply and distribution of PMS nationwide. We thank all Nigerians for their understanding and support in many forms as always.” it added
