By Ifeanyi Nwoko The Senate on Tuesday adjourned its plenary in honour of late Sen. Ali Wakili who died on Saturday in Abuja. The resolution of the Senate to adjourn its plenary followed a motion moved by the Leader of the Senate Ahmed Lawan. Presenting the motion, Lawan said that the nation had indeed lost a lawmaker who fought for the development of democracy in the country. “On the 17th of this month, Saturday we woke up to a very sad news of the death of our friend, our brother and our colleague, very distinguished senator Ali Wakili,” Lawan said. “Mr president this is sad for not only this senate. Not only his senatorial district that he represented but for his entire country and the development of democracy in Nigeria “It is tradition that when this kind of divine incident happens and we lose a colleague in the senate or house of representatives we normally observe one-minute silence in the honour of the departed but also adjourn plenary and suspend activities in the national assembly in honour of the deceased. May his soul rest in peace.” On his part, Senate President Bukola Saraki said a special valedictory session would be held in Wakili’s honour on Wednesday. Thereafter senate was adjourned to Wednesday when a valedictory session will be held in honour of Wakili. It is the tradition of both houses to adjourn its next day of plenary following the death of any serving member of the National Assembly.
