Officers from Britain’s information regulator are raiding the London offices of data firm Cambridge Analytica after being granted a warrant as part of an investigation into alleged misuse of personal information. A High Court judge granted the warrant Friday evening. Soon afterward, 18 people, some in Information Commissioner’s Office jackets, entered the company’s central London offices. The information commissioner is investigating whether the firm improperly used data from some 50 million Facebook users to target voters with ads and political messages.

Authorities in the United States and Britain are investigating whether Cambridge Analytica and Facebook broke the law in their use of personal information. Read also
