The state Deputy Commissioner of Police (Operations), Mr Mohammed Ali, made the disclosure to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday. He said that the arrested persons had been transferred to the Taskforce Office,  Oshodi, Lagos.

The situation has been brought under control. “Our men will be here until total peace is restored,” Ali said. NAN learnt that the two groups were scavengers gathering and selling unserviceable items at a place called “Igidanpani. The clash forced shops in the New Garage and some parts of Ojota to close. “We don’t really know what caused the crisis.
