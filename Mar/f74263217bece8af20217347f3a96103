He said that the festival would be  organised  in partnership with Lagos State Government,  adding that the initiative was in tandem with government’s drive for promoting the city as a tourism hub. According to him, it is also part of the government effort to diversify the econoy. “This is  tandem with diversifying Nigeria’s economy and  to reduce continued dependence on crude oil as  the only source of revenue. “it is time the private sector takes the bull by the horns, to take charge of the tourism sector. “This urge in turn  will give rise to the inspiration for us entrepreneurs to partner with the Federal Government, through the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture,” he said He added that the festival would create a market place which will feature cuisines and culture of the West African country. This, he noted would culminate into a festive exhibition.
