The June 12 summit in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and President Kim Jong Un of North Korea, may have run into unexpected obstacles. Singapore Strait Times has reported that  rooms at either  Shangri-La Hotel or  Marina Bay Sands, believed as the most possible venue for the  summit have sold out. The Shangri-La Hotel hosts the high-level Shangri-La security dialogue every year. This year, the IISS Shangri-La Dialogue will be held from June 1 to 3. The hotel is the most likely venue for the Trump-Kim Summit, the local media said. But previously, the hotel said in a statement that it has not received confirmation on the venue and is not in a position to make any comments on behalf of the stakeholders involved in the preparation of this summit. Trump tweeted on Thursday that the highly anticipated meeting between Kim Jong Un and himself will take place in Singapore on June 12.
