By Ijendu Iheaka Some Aba residents have commended Mr Ossy Prestige, a member of the House of Representatives for giving face-lift to some roads in his constituency. The residents, who spoke in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Wednesday in Aba, said that Prestige, who represents Aba North/Aba South, had relieved them of pains of plying on bad road. Prestige of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), had graded a network of over 15 roads that connect communities within the area, which had been in very deplorable conditions since 2008. The roads are: Hitex, Odozi Obodo, Elvina, Aja, Umuibe, Ajali, Ukadike, Agu, Umuibe, and Onyemaechi areas, among others. Mr Ben Harrison, a driver living around Awkuzu by Agu Road, said the road was in deplorable condition before the intervention by Prestige. He thanked the House of Representatives member for making the roads in their neighbourhood passable. Mr Ndu Onyeibe, who lives around Hitex, said that the federal lawmaker had made the area accessible through massive grading of roads linking the area. “I know him because he graded Hitex Road and has now made it accessible. He was visiting the area during the rehabilitation. “If others who were at the House of Representatives before him had done such things for us, our roads would have been better and easier to pass.
“He provided residents of the area a borehole at Agu Road with solar energy to power it, this is commendable. “ If other politicians will be doing little things for us like he had done, we will be better off,” he said. Mrs Chinyere Ikechi, a trader living at Uzomkpa Street, said that it was good that the lawmaker graded many roads around the area. She said that the roads were minor roads, and stressed the need to give Ohanku Road face-lift, as it is the major road in the area. Ikechi said that the Abia Government should complement the effort of Prestige by giving Ohanku face-lift, as it would further boost accessibility in the area.
