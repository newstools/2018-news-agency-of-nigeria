Twenty-four hours after he was arrested, Alexei Navalny, the leader of protests against President Vladimir Putin that resulted in the arrests of more than 1,500 demonstrators across Russia, says he has been released from detention. Navalny said Sunday on Twitter that he had been released after being arrested on Moscow’s Pushkin Square on Saturday but that he faced charges of organising an unauthorized meeting and resisting police. Each of those charges can carry a jail sentence of 15 days. OND-Info, an organization that monitors Russian political arrests, said at least 1,575 people were arrested in demonstrations in 26 cities across Russia protesting Putin’s upcoming inauguration Monday for a new term. It was not clear Sunday how many remained in custody. Amnesty International called the arrests and beatings of some Russian protesters “outrageous.”
