Senator Dino Melaye has been remanded in police custody until 11 June by a Lokoja senior Magistrates’ court. The order was made today after he was arraigned at the court. The senator who represents Kogi West was brought in a police ambulance at about 9:17 a.m. and was immediately stretchered into the court by policemen. Before his arrival, heavily armed policemen had taken positions within and outside the court premises to forestall unforeseen circumstances. The arrival of the senator in court attracted the attention of workers and others who came for transactions. Other courts within the premises were also not sitting as at the time of this report. Also, newsmen and others that had seated in court for hours were all asked to go out for security checks. At the end, only few were allowed inside. The senator was charged with illegal supply of arms and money to two thugs, who were arrested earlier and were said to have made confessions. The senator had, before being brought to court, first been taken to the SARS headquarters near the NTA office in Lokoja. Melaye yesterday was  arraigned at a magistrates’ court in Abuja and was granted bail for N90 million. The police immediately rearrested him.
