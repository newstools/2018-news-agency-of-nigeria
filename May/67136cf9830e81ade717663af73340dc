Iran has swiftly announced its reaction to the dumping of the 2015 nuclear deal by unilateralist US leader, Donald Trump, saying it could resume uranium enrichment, ‘without limit’. President Hassan Rouhani announced this today, moments after Trump jettisoned the deal signed by five other European powers,  including France,  Britain and Germany. Earlier, Iranian state television said on Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal was “illegal, illegitimate and undermines international agreements”. Trump said he was reimposing economic sanctions on Iran and pulling the United States out of an international agreement aimed at stopping Tehran from obtaining a nuclear bomb.
