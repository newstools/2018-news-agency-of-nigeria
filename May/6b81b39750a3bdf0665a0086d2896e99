By Racheal Ishaya Jigawa State government has every reason to be happy, as the Board of Directors, African Development Bank (AfDB) has approved 1.5 million dollars grant to support the implementation of the state “One Giga Watt (GW) Independent Power Producer (IPP) Solar Procurement Programme’’. AfDB in a statement issued on Wednesday, said the approval reaffirmed the bank’s commitment to developing renewable energy and increasing energy access on the continent. “At full one GW capacity, the programme will assist the government to achieve its national goals of reaching 75 per cent electricity access by 2020. “It will also provide electricity to unserved and underserved areas, particularly in northern Nigeria where access rates are lowest. “It will also increase the share of renewable energy in the energy mix to 30 per cent by 2030,’’ AfDB said. The bank said the approved grant would also support the completion of outstanding technical and feasibility studies and the design of a master plan for the entire programme site. The bank, however, said that its willingness to provide additional support for the project would be determined by the outcome of the technical and feasibility studies. The statement also quoted the Bank’s Vice-President for Power, Energy, Climate and Green Growth, Mr Amadou Hott, a saying “the approval solidifies the Bank’s commitment to Nigeria in resolving its chronic power shortage’’. “It is important for us to deliver a seamless implementation and provide necessary support to the government to conduct an effective IPP procurement process. “An intergovernmental team led by Rural Electrification Agency of Nigeria will be the implementation agency for the grant,’’ he said.
