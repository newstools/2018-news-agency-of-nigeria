In a clearance operation, no fewer than 18 suspected bandits have been killed and 56 others arrested by the Kaduna State Police. The suspects are alleged to be responsible for the killings and kidnappings in Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of the state and some communities in neighbouring Zamfara State. The Force also said it has arrested a gang that was responsible for the killing of some security personnel in Birnin Gwari two months ago. The arrested suspects were paraded before newsmen at Katari Divisional Police Station in Kaduna state. The Force Public Relations Officer, Mr. Jimoh Moshood, said they were arrested by the Joint Police Special Team deployed by the Inspector General of Police to curb the incessant attacks on innocent citizens. Moshood further disclosed that 64 AK47 rifles, ammunition and 11 vehicles were recovered from the bandits during an operation that lasted for several hours. In recent time, increased activities of criminals along the Birnin Gwari-Zamfara road have created fear and anxiety among road users as well as residents of the area. With the latest onslaught against the criminal elements, the residents, however, have a renewed hope that crime may soon be eradicated in the state.
