By Joshua Oladipo The arraignment of Alfred Aderibigbe in  an Osun High Court for  the alleged killing  of late Sen.  Isiaka Adeleke  was on Wednesday in Osogbo stalled following the  absence of the presiding judge,  Justice Ayo Oyebiyi. The   Solicitor General of the state, Mr Dapo Adeniji, however, agreed with Aderibigbe’s counsel, Mr Soji Oyetayo, on June  8 as the new date for  the arraignment of the accused. The Magistrate Olusegun Ayilara-led coroner inquest had recommended Aderibigbe  for prosecution, having established that he administered the  drug overdose that killed Adeleke. Aderibigbe, said to be a nurse, while testifying before the coroner, said the drugs he gave the late senator were those given to him by the deceased. He also insisted that he did not give the late senator an overdose. But the Chief Medical Director of Ladoke Akintola University Teaching Hospital(LAUTECH), Osogbo, Prof. Akeem Lasisi,  had said that Adeleke died of drug overdose. Also testifying, the Consultant Pathologist, who carried out the autopsy on Adeleke’s corpse, Dr Taiwo Sholaja, had maintained that the senator died of drug overdose.
