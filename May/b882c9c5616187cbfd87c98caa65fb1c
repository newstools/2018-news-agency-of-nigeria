The White House on Saturday strongly objected to China’s demand that US airlines change the way they refer to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau to comply with Chinese law. The Chinese Civil Aviation Administration last month sent a letter to 36 foreign airlines, including a number of US carriers, according to a White House statement. The letter demanded that carriers change how they identified Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau on their websites and in their promotional material so that the references align with the Communist Party’s standards. “This is Orwellian nonsense and part of a growing trend by the Chinese Communist Party to impose its political views on American citizens and private companies,” the statement said. The statement added that the United States “strongly objects to China’s attempts to compel private firms to use specific language of a political nature in their publicly available content.” The US respects the freedom private companies have in their interactions with their customers, both in the US and abroad, the statement said, calling the demand an attempt to export censorship and political correctness to the US and the rest of the free world. “President Donald J Trump ran against political correctness in the United States,” the statement said. “He will stand up for Americans resisting efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to impose Chinese political correctness on American companies and citizens.”(dpa/NAN)
