By Auwalu Yusuf The Sandanmu Local Education Authority in Katsina State says the Federal Government School Feeding Programme has raised pupils’ enrolment in the area by 40 per cent. Malam Ya’u Karkarku, the Education Secretary of the area told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Sandamu on Friday that total pupils enrolment previously was between 60 per cent and 65 per cent, but had jumped to about 92 per cent. “The feeding programme has positively changed the attitudes of some parents and guardians towards the education of their children as shown by the dramatic increase in enrolment figures. “82 food vendors have been formally registered into the programme across the 55 existing primary schools in the area. “We will in due course increase the number of the food vendors for wider and efficient coverage,’’ he said. The official warned the food vendors against late delivery of food to the designated schools, stressing that laxity and deliberate sabotage of the programme would not be tolerated. He lauded the efforts of the school authorities, the school-based management committees and Parent-Teachers Associations for their constant support towards the development of education in the area. Karkarku commended Katsina State Government for its commitment and dedication to improving the welfare of teachers, especially through regular payment of entitlements. He said that the government was also committed to capacity building and implementation of promotion to deserving teachers. Normal academic activities for the third term have begun in earnest in primary and secondary schools in Katsina State.
