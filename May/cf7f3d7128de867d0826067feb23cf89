“We’re ready to fulfill the potential in all 11 media centers, we did similar work during the 2017 Confederations Cup,” head of Rossiya Segodnya’s International Multimedia Press Center Olga Koleva said. Rossiya Segodnya will be operating media centers in the 2018 World Cup host cities, providing the accredited journalists with workplaces, free Wi-Fi access, lockers and excursions, and enabling them to watch the World Cup matches as well as attend workshops, press conferences and briefings. Journalists can gain access to the press centers by submitting an application on the media centers’ website by May 30. Russia’s first-ever FIFA World Cup will take place from June 14 to July 15 in 11 host cities, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kaliningrad, Volgograd, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, Samara, Saransk, Rostov-on-Don, Yekaterinburg, and Sochi.
