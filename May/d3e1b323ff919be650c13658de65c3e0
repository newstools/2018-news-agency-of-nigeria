 Boris Johnson, a British politician has advised President Trump not to give up on the Iran nuclear deal, saying “at this delicate juncture it would be a mistake to walk away”. The foreign secretary is in Washington to persuade the US president to remain a part of the international accord. The deal saw Iran agree to limit its nuclear activities in return for the easing of sanctions on its economy. The UK and its European allies have until 12 May to persuade Mr Trump to stick with the deal. Mr Trump has strongly criticised the agreement, which he calls “insane”. Britain, France and Germany have been working behind the scenes for weeks in an effort to preserve the deal, which was orchestrated under the Obama administration, and includes Russia and China as signatories. Mr Johnson argued “only Iran would gain” from abandoning nuclear restrictions. “Of all the options we have for ensuring that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon, this pact offers the fewest disadvantages,” he wrote. “It has weaknesses, certainly, but I am convinced they can be remedied. “Indeed at this moment Britain is working alongside the Trump administration and our French and German allies to ensure that they are.” Mr Johnson said the deal had put restrictions on Iran’s nuclear programme and “now that these handcuffs are in place, I see no possible advantage in casting them aside”. He added: “The wisest course would be to improve the handcuffs rather than break them.” Read More athttp://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44026548
