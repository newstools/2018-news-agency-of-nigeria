The police commissioner advised the electorate to obey the rules guiding the electoral process. “Avoid anything that would bring problem to the electoral process; it is to our advantage to have vibrant democracy.’’ Iwar urged politicians to control and guide their supporters to ensure a smooth, free, fair and credible electoral process. “You are also to note that using electronic voting in this local government election is first of its kind in Nigeria. “The system is very transparent, difficult to manipulate, so, whoever snatches ballot boxes will not achieve anything.” Iwar siad.
