 By Lucy Nwachukwu The Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) has urged Ministries Departments and Agency (MDAs) to generate practical ideas that would boost the actualisation of Public Private Partnership (PPP) programmes in the country. Mr Chidi Izuwah, ICRC’s Acting Director-General, said this at the PPP Units Consultative Forum (3PUCF) on Thursday in Abuja. Izuwah, represented by the Director, PPP Resource Department, Mr Mike Ohiani, said the commission had provided capacity building programmes for MDAs and organised workshops for engagement with the private sector. This, he said, was aimed at improving PPP knowledge for implementation of projects in the country. Izuwah pledged the commission’s willingness to continue to support MDAs to improve PPP projects, while expressing optimism that the country would achieve more PPP projects through the collaborative efforts of MDAs. He reiterated the importance of the quarterly meeting, which he said created an avenue for MDAS to present issues relevant to PPP projects. In his opening remark, Dr Abdukadir Muazu, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, thanked the ICRC for the capacity building training for members of the ministry. Muazu, represented by the Director, Human Resource, Mallam Sanusi Ashiru, said there was no doubt that the deliberations would impact positively on infrastructure development in the country. He pledged the ministry’s commitment to the growth of PPP in the country. Also Mr Leon Aliboh, Permanent Secretary, Special Duties, Head of Civil Service of the Federation, stressed the need to enhance synergy between the public and private sector of the economy. He said this would deliver sustainable PPP projects in the country. Aliboh urged members of the 3PCUF to use the platform to mobilise private sector resources for national development. (NAN)
