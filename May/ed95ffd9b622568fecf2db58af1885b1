By Taiye Elebiyo-Edeni The Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) has expressed excitement over the lifting of the 10-year ban on the association from operating in Nasarawa State. Mr Musa Isiwele, the National President of the association, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja that ban was lifted by a High Court of Justice in the state. He said that the judgment was delivered by Justice J. Abundaga. Isiwele said the court ordered that the association had the right to operate at their designated motor parks in Lafia and Nasarawa entirely, stating that they were a recognised trade union listed under the Trade Union Act. He said the court also ordered that the incessant disruption of the activities through harassment and intimidation was breach and infringement to their fundamental right to freedom of association. The RTEAN boss said the judgement signified that there was hope in the judiciary, noting that it was good to always seek redress at the court. “They have never allowed RTEAN to operate in Nasarawa. The National union was always oppressing them, so we went to court and the judgment was in our favour; that as a trade union we are free to operate in any part of the country. “I feel so happy about the judgment because I have been telling my people not to fight, I always tell them that what peace cannot give you, crisis cannot give it to you. “I give kudos to the judge because it shows that he his not corrupt and people can still have faith in the judiciary.” Isiwele said that RTEAN operation would commence in the State in the areas allocated to them.
