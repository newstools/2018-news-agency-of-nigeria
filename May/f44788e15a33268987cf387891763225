By Peter Okolie The Ebuka Okafor Foundation (EOF), an NGO, says it empowers more than 7,000 widows and the less privileged in five years in Anambra. The initiator of the foundation, Chief Ebuka Okafor, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Onitsha on Thursday that the organisation started its philanthropic activities in Anambra in 2013, caring for widows and the less privileged and vulnerable, numbering about 50. “In 2014, over 2,000 widows were trained in production of confectioneries and household items such as detergents, insecticides, liquid soaps, air fresheners and perfumes, among others. “They were provided with the required materials, including chemicals to start off their businesses, and paid one year rent for each of the trainees for shops,” he said.
Okafor also said over 3,000 widows and the less privileged received free screening and treatment for general ailments, including eye problems, blood pressure, blood sugar level, viral test, and bacterial infections in 2015. He said that more widows, the aged and some youths also benefited from the foundation skill acquisition programme and free medical services in 2016 and 2017. “The foundation hopes to facilitate the process of sustainable development and integration of widows, the under-privileged and vulnerable persons into the main stream of society. “Giving is not determined by how much you have, but how much your heart truly desires to sacrifice.” The business mogul said that the 2018 empowerment programme would soon be announced.
Okafor, who recently received the award for his fight against malaria scourge from Anambra Government, called for intensified advocacy for effective policy in favour of development of women and the less privileged. “Government generally should show more commitment toward alleviating the plights of widows.”
