By Ayinde Abdulsaheed Olaide Some members of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Bauchi state have called for the cancellation of the party ward congress held in the state on May 5, describing the exercise as fraudulent. Addressing newsmen in Bauchi on Tuesday through their spokesperson, Alhaji Shehu Ningi, the members, under the platform of “APC Supporters Network,” said the exercise was not only fraudulent, but also a “scandal” that ought to attract the attention of “ICPC”. “We find the declaration of the ward congress in the state a success as objectionable and condemnable. “Members of APC and members of the general public are living witnesses to the fact that no Ward Congress took place at all throughout the state,” they insisted. They alleged that no electoral officer or member of the election committee was seen at almost all the venues for the congress. According to them, voters waited from morning till evening on the day of the congress without seeing anybody to conduct the election. “In view of the fraud, we are therefore calling for the cancellation of the Ward Congress purported to have been carried out on Saturday 5th May 2018. “We are also calling for a repeat of the Ward Congress, to be conducted by a different state election committee. “Failure to listen to us will definitely jeopardize the hitherto brilliant chances of the party at the polls, come 2019 general elections,” they said. The chairman of the congress committee, Mr Tony Macfoy, had earlier told newsmen that the congress was conducted peacefully and successfully. “All the grievances within the party stakeholders were amicably resolved before the conduct of the congress,” he said
