The youths who came out in their numbers drummed support for Akinwale as the candidate ‘that will reposition and bring development to the local government’ adding that the aspirant was dogged, youthful, resourceful and entrepreneurial. The youths under the auspices of “Movement for Youth Agenda” (MYA) said their support for the state assembly aspirant was due to their desire to see the growth of the local government. Speaking on behalf of the group, the secretary of the group Mr Dada Olorunmaiye admitted that the area had been under stagnation for a long time. He said that the group, made up of over 1000 members from the various wards have unanimously agreed and endorsed Akinwale as their sole candidate for the house of assembly position. “He is a youth like us, hence we can challenge him on all fronts if things are not going well, Unlike the older generation who would deny us audience. “2019 will be about charting a new course in the political terrain in Kabba/Bunu, “We would dispense the old force and usher in young and vibrant minds who will be ready to deliver the dividends of political gains to our youths,” he said. He noted that youths were the future of every nation and Nigeria was no exception adding that the time had come for youths to strategically position themselves during the 2019 general elections and beyond. “We have got a lot of potentials in our youths and we must be ready to maximize that potential. We are using Akinwale Samuel-Aledare as a stepping stone for Kabba/Bunu Youths,” he said.
