Ahead of the 2019 general elections, the National Population Commission (NPC) says it has commenced the listing of all dead persons in the country for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Mr Eze Duruiheoma, the Chairman of the commission, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Tuesday that NPC would complete the process and hand over the accurate data to INEC within two months. Recently, during the process for the failed recall of Senator Dino Melaye, allegations were rife that many of the signatures on the voter register submitted for the recall, were those of dead people. The NPC therefore said that they were working to make the data available to INEC. “In the next one month or two, the data will be made available but we have to be sure of the numbers before we make it available to INEC. “We do not have 100 per cent coverage in registration of deaths and births. “But the 50 per cent we have from it will be made available to INEC for them to clean out dead names from voters register,’’ he said. He said that the final stage of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between INEC and NPC would be implemented soon. He reassured that the partnership between the two agencies would help ascertain records of dead people nationwide. NAN recalls that INEC recently requested for the list of dead citizens in the country from NPC, beginning from 2015, to enable it “sanitise’’ the voters register.
